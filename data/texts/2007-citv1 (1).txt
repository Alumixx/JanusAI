Abstract:  
 
A  bimetric  description  of  the  Universe  is  proposed,  which  may  explain  the  cosmic 
acceleration deduced from optically observed high-redshift  supernovae. This phenomenon is 
classically  charged  to  a  mysterious  repulsive  "dark  energy"  whose  true  nature  remains 
unknown. It is identified in the present model with a set of particles having negative mass and 
energy. These negative mass particles are emitting negative energy photons, hence they are 
not observable using optical instruments.

1 – Introduction 
 
For years, astrophysicists and cosmologists have tried to define which of the three Friedmann 
models, solutions to Einstein's equations, fit the observations. With time, a general consensus 
had been established to conclude that in Einstein's equations, the cosmological constant Λ had 
to be zero. Thus the cosmological model was supposed to rise from the Friedmann equation: 
(1)

where  the  second  derivative  of  R(t)  could  only  be  negative.  However,  measurements 
performed  on  distant  supernovae  over  the  last  decade  have  revealed  an  unexpected 
acceleration of the cosmic expansion, R’’ becoming positive for high redshifts[, deep space]. 
Todays, specialists think that cosmic dynamics depends on three components:  
 

-  Visible matter:                   4 %   
-  Dark matter (attractive):  22 %  
-  Dark energy (repulsive):  74 % 
 

2

 

 

 

 

 

The last component, whose existence had been neglected until now recently, might well 
explain the observed acceleration if it is basically related to repulsive forces. 
 
As  shown  below,  it  is  possible  to  obtain  such  an  effect  if  we  suppose  the  Universe 
consisting of:  

-  Particles with non-zero, positive mass and positive energy. 

-  Particles with zero mass: positive energy photons. 

-  Particles with non-zero, negative mass and negative energy. 

-  Particles with zero mass: negative energy photons. 

 
Group theory accounts for this since a long time. Relativistic dynamics of a material point is 
associated with the dynamic Poincaré group, which is based on the Lorentz group. If Γ  is the 
Gramm matrix:

the Lorentz group can be represented by (4,4) matrices L . Hence:  
(3) 

 
If C is the space-time translation vector:  
(4) 

 
then Poincaré's group corresponds to the matrix:  
(5) 

 
 
The Lorentz group owns four connected components. Using a terminology borrowed from  
reference  [1]  the  first  two  ones  form  the orthochron  subgroup  and  do  not  reverse  the  time 
coordinate. The last two ones constitute the antichron subset and their components reverse 
time. The Poincaré group, owing ten dimensions, inherits this property and also owns four 
connected components. Let us call Lo the matrices of the antichron subgroup of the Lorentz

group.  The  set  of  matrices  made  from  the  neutral  component  Ln  of  the  Lorentz  group  is 
traditionally known as the restricted Poincaré group:  
(5bis) 

 
Now, writing the matrix of the orthochron subgroup of Poincaré's group:  
(6) 

 
the complete  group can be written:  
(7)

with λ= ± 1 

 
In reference [1] J.M.Souriau built the coadjoint action of Poincaré's group on its momentum 
space, which owns the same number of dimensions as the group. He writes the momentum by 
forming, with four of its components, the energy-impulsion vector P : 
(8) 

 
and  bringing  together  the  last  six  components,  which  form  an  antisymmetric  matrix  M, 
Souriau then writes the momentum of Poincaré's group:  
(9) 

 
The coadjoint action of Poincaré's group on its Lie algebra then gives: 
(10) 

(11) 

M’ = Lo M tLo  +   ( C  tP  tLo  - Lo P  tC ) 

 
This  result  can  be  found  in  reference  [1],  page  198.  It  clearly  shows  that  the  antichron 
components  of  Poincaré's  group  transform  any  orthochron  movement  (corresponding  to  a 
{M,P} set of the momentum components) with positive energy into an antichron movement 
with negative energy. As highlighted by the author of "Structure of Dynamical Systems", in 
order  to  avoid  the  problems  caused  by  negative  energy  (and  negative  mass)  particles, 
relativistic  dynamics  of  material  points  can  arbitrarily  be  limited  to  the  restricted  Poincaré 
group.

2) A world populated by positive and negative energy particles 
 
But  todays,  particles  with  negative  energy  and  mass  should  be  taken  into  account,  which 
implies  having  recourse  to  the  complete  Poincaré  group,  outfitted  with  its  orthochron  and 
antichron components.  
 
Notice importantly that antichron components of the group also transform orthochron photons 
movements with positive energy into antichron movements with negative energy. 
 
We can then suppose that real observers, or measuring instruments, being made of particles 
with positive mass and energy, they are not able to deal with negative energy photons, and 
conversely that hypothetic observers and measuring instruments made of negative mass and 
energy particles, would not be able to deal with positive energy photons.  
 
From this point of view the two cosmic contents, one with positive energy and the other with 
negative energy, cannot interact through electromagnetic waves. Concretely, this implies that 
if our Universe contains negative mass and energy particles, we cannot see them nor record 
images of them with optical devices such as telescopes, whatever the frequency considered.  
 
 
3) The  true nature of antimatter  
 
It  is  possible  to  consider  that  antimatter  particles  correspond  to  other  kinds  of  a  material 
point's  relativistic  movements.  The  electric  charge  q  can  be  geometrized,  making  of  it  an 
additional  component  of  the  momentum,  by  extending  Poincaré's  group.  Introducing  an 
additional parameter ν  we can then bring out (as explained in reference [2], chapter 5, page 
413) the fact that the fifth dimension of Kaluza comes with a charge reversal. Let us introduce 
the four-vector:

and the five-vector: 
(13) 

 
where  ζ  represents  the  additional  dimension  of  Kaluza.  We  define  this  property  by 
introducing the group of four connected components:

The group momentum  has 11 components:

Starting from the movement of a material point supposed equivalent to a matter particle of 
positive mass and energy, the action of an element ( ν = - 1 ) from the group will reverse the 
extra dimension of Kaluza and its associated charge, and this movement will become that of 
an antimatter particle. Since this action does not concern the four-vector P, it is classically 
deduced that antimatter has positive energy and mass.  
 
 
3) About negative energy antimatter 
 
If we decide that our physics, that relativistic dynamics of the material point, are dependent on 
the restricted dynamic Poincaré group or on the orthochron subgroup of the Poincaré group, 
then the Universe is only made of particles having both mass and energy of the same sign 
(positive).  
 
If  we  extend  the  group  as  shown  above,  by  introducing  the  additional  dimension ζ  and  by 
doubling  the  number  of  components  (which  goes  from  two  to  four)  we  obtain  a  Universe 
populated by matter and antimatter.  
 
If, in the group above, the Lorentz group restricted to its orthochron components is replaced 
by the complete Lorentz group, we obtain a group of eight connected components with six 
kinds of particles: 
 

-  Matter particles of positive energy and mass.  
-  Antimatter particles of positive energy and mass.  
-  Photons of positive energy (the photon is its own antiparticle) 
 
-  Matter particles of negative energy and mass.  
-  Antimatter particles of negative energy and mass.  
-  Photons of negative energy (the photon is its own antiparticle) 

 
By  combining  in  the  following  way  (admittedly  arbitrary)  the  transformations  reversing 
space, time and charge, we can write:  
(19) 

νλ
⎡
⎢
0

⎣

0
Lλ
0

φνλ
⎤
⎥
⎥
⎥
⎦

C
1

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

Then the action of the group on its momentum space is written:  

q’ = λ ν  q 

P’ = λ Lo P 

 

6

 

 

M’ = Lo M tLo  +   ( C  tP  tLo  - Lo P  tC ) 

 
Hence, reversing the sign of λ brings a reversal of charge, space and time, in other words a 
CPT-symmetry.  
 
 
4) Construction of an interaction between positive energy particles and negative energy 
particles. Bimetric configuration, bigravity. 
 
By choosing the complete Poincaré group, we obtained an invisible « second matter species ». 
In order for it to have the properties of dark energy, laws of gravitational interaction giving a 
repulsive nature to this « matter-dark energy » are needed. 
 
Writing Einstein’s equation:  
(20) 

 
S  is  a  geometrical  tensor,  i.e.  Einstein's  tensor  S(g)  built  from  the  metric  g  associated  to  a 
four-dimensional manifold. T is a tensor density representing the energy-matter content of the 
Universe, χ is Einstein’s constant: 
(21) 

S = χ T – g Λ  

χ −=

8

Gπ
c

2

 

 
and Λ is the cosmological constant.  
 
g belongs to a function space sometimes called hyperspace. The Einstein tensor is, in absolute 
value, the gradient of the Hilbert functional: 
(22) 

gH

(

)

=

(

gRa

(

)

+

gVdb
)

 

∫

M

 
in which a and b are constants and R  the scalar curvature. This functional is invariant by 
diffeomorphism. Einstein’s constant χ = 1/a derives from constant a only, while a and b give 
the cosmological constant Λ = b/2a . Let us set Λ = 0, which amounts to take b = 0. Thereafter 
we will not need it. So we restrict (22) to: 
(23) 

gH

(

)

∫=

M

gVdgRa

(

)

 

 
We  build  the  Einstein  tensor  S  as  a  gradient  of  this  fonctional  in  the  space  of  metrics. 
Associated with a tensor density T we obtain the equation:  
(24) 

 

7

S = χ T  

 
where the unknown term is the metric g and where the problem directly hinge upon the value 
of this tensor density T.  
 
Now we suppose the Universe is a four-dimensional manifold M4 fitted up with two metrics, 
which we call g+ and g-.  
 
We also suppose that positive energy particles follow the geodesics resulting from metrics g+, 
while negative energy particles progress along geodesics  resulting from metrics g-.  
 
It is geometrically impossible for a positive energy particle to move along a geodesic deduced 
from the metric g - , and conversely for a negative energy particle to move along a geodesic 
deduced from the metric g + .  
 
From the metric g+ a geometrical tensor S  + can be built, and in the same manner from the 
metric g –  a geometrical tensor S - . Let us take the Einstein field equation again, which we 
will write: 
(25) 

S + ( g +) = χ T  

 
T  is  a  tensor  density  which  contains  the  problem  data,  the  energy-matter  density  at  the 
considered point. This is the conjugation of two contributions.  
 
ρ + will designate the density of positive energy matter.  
 
In order to tally with previous works (references [7] to [11]) we decide to designate with  
ρ -  the  absolute  value  of  the  density  of  negative  mass  matter.  Same  thing  for  the  pressure 
terms involved in the tensor density of this second kind of matter, so we will designate with  
T  –  the  absolute  value  of  the  tensor  density  of  an  energy-matter  corresponding  to  negative 
energy and mass. Thereby we write:  
(26) 

S + ( g +) = χ (  T + - T  - )  

 
 
Now we are going to create a coupling between both metrics, and we will call them conjugate 
metrics.  Let  us  take  again  the  development  which  brought  us  to  the  construction  of  the 
Einstein’s equation. We write the Hilbert functional: 
(27) 

+

gH

(

)

=

Ra

+

(

g

)

gVd

 

∫

M

 
from where the derivative gives the geometrical tensor S + (g +) which is the gradient of this 
functional in the metrics function space, in the hyperspace. We suppose the geometrical tensor 
 

 
is a derivative from the Hilbert functional:  
(28) 

S - ( g -)

gH

(

−=

−

gH

(

)

 

= ∫

M

 
Since the geometrical tensor is the gradient of the functional in the metrics space, this implies  
(29) 

S + ( g +) = - S - ( g -) 

 
 
and hence both metrics are not independant.  
 

Let us call them conjugate  metrics, a new mathematical concept. 

 
If metric g+ is known, then metric g– can be deduced. We can write the two equations (26) and 
(29) as follow: 
(30) 

S + ( g +) = χ (  T + - T  - )  

S - ( g -) = χ (  T  - - T + )  

 
 
And it is in that form this coupled field equations system had been published for the first time 
in the Nuevo Cimento review in 1994 ([10]).  
 
 
5) Newtonian approximation 
 
This  approximation  allows  to  understand  the  dynamics  arising  from  this  system.  We  will 
expand these equations into a series, on the basis of a situation at zero order, where the second 
members are null and where the metrics, assumed as stationary, are Lorentzian. We suppose 
curvatures are weak and agitations velocities in the two « cosmic fluids » are low compared to 
the speed of light. We have:  
(32) 

g + = η+ ( Lorentz )  + ε  γ  + 

g - = η - ( Lorentz )  + ε  γ  - 

 
where  ε is a small parameter. We expend  the two metrics into series, using the traditional 
method. This calculation is present in all books dealing with General Relativity (i.e. in [the] 
reference [12], chapter 4, section 4.3). As a result, we get the following for the movements of 
positive mass and energy particles, along geodesics of the metric g + :  
(34) 

 
and  for  the  movements  of  negative  mass  and  energy  particles,  along  geodesics  of  the 
metric g - :

-  Particles having mass of opposite sign repel each others through « anti-Newton law »

One advantage of such a description of the « dark energy » is that its nature becomes rather 
simple:  its  components  are  merely  the  same  as  those  of  normal  matter,  but  simply  with 
negative mass and energy. They are no longer « exotic » but consist of: 
 

-  Protons and antiprotons with negative mass and energy 
-  Neutrons and antineutrons with negative mass and energy 
-  Electrons and anti-electrons with negative mass and energy 
-  Photons with negative energy 

 
 
6) About the cosmic acceleration 
 
In cosmology, observations show a reacceleration of the Universe for high redshifts. Can we 
reach such a result by identifying the dark energy to this negative energy-matter? To do so a 
cosmological model will be built, based on a solution in the form of a couple of conjugated 
metrics ( g +, g - ). We take riemannian metrics of signature ( + - - - ) adding the hypothesis of 
homogeneity and isotropy. This leads us to Robertson-Walker metrics:

Our Universe is bimetric. Points of this manifold can be located using an arbitrary frame of 
reference. In the above expression we find  
 
- a  time-marker   t  
- space markers   u , θ , ϕ  
 
The first term designates the time coordinate, and the three others the space coordinates. Such 
quantities can be considered as simple numbers, or angles, and be written:  
 

[ τ  , u , θ , ϕ  ] 

 
 
Let us show that theses coordinates are a common frame of reference for two sets of mass-
points corresponding to positive and negative energies. Consider two points A and B, with 
coordinates: 
 

[ uA , θ A , ϕA  ]      and        [ uB , θB

 B , ϕB  ] 

 
If these two sets of numbers remain constant through time, such points are co-moving. Since 
we  are  in  a  situation  of  isotropy  and  homogeneity,  points  A  and  B  can  be  linked  through

geodesic curves, however calculated from the basically different metrics g  + et g  –. Lengths 
may differ, insofar as their corresponding scale factors R + and R – might no more be equal.  
 
In an expanding or simply evolving Universe, both scale factors will vary according to laws: 
 

R + (τ )     and      R –  (τ ) 

 
So we get two measurements of arc AB and two different lengths, whether the measurement 
is taken in the world of positive energies and masses with the metric g +, or in the world of 
negative energies and masses with the metric g –.  
 

-  According to the first measurement, the length of arc AB will vary like R + (τ ) 
-  According to the second measurement, the length of arc AB will vary like R –  (τ ) 

 
Now  consider  a  3-ball  BB3  ,  whose  boundary  is  a  sphere  S2.  Once  again  we  get  different 
measurements for the surface of the sphere S2 or the volume of the 3-ball B3B  depending on the 
metric we rely on : 
 

-  Refering to  metric g+ the area of  sphere S2 will vary like R+2 and the volume of  ball 

 
-  Refering to metric g – the area of  sphere S2 will vary like R-2 and the volume of  ball 

BB3 like R+3 

BB3 like R -3 

 

ρ + and ρ –  represent the densities of the two species. By expressing mass conservation, we

If    R + > R -      then     R + ’’  > 0   and     R - ’’ < 0 

 
and vice-versa.  
 
We  thus  obtain  an  acceleration  effect  on  the  expansion  for  the  positive  mass  and  energy 
population, and a reverse phenomenon for the negative mass and energy population: 
 

 

Scale factors evolution 

 

 
We must remember that what we actually measure is a redshift related to the derivative of the 
scale factor R. The important thing is to take account of the observations. Measurements of 
the recession speed  for the most remote  supernovae have revealed  a re-acceleration of the 
expansion  that is commonly charged to a mysterious dark energy. The model presented here 
is an alternative interpretation for its nature.  
 
 
Conclusion  
 
The  present  work,  based  on  a  bimetric  description  of  the  Universe  going  with  a  bigravity 
dynamics,  accounts  for  the  re-acceleration  of  the  part  of  the  Universe  accessible  to  optical 
observations, a phenomenon charged until now to a mysterious repulsive dark energy whose 
true nature remains unknown. Our model fully accounts for this phenomenon, through a new

concept of negative mass and energy particles: emitting negative energy photons, they are not 
observable using optical instruments.  
 
Applied to the very early Universe, our model provides a common law of linear evolution for 
the scale factors  R  + et R  –  with respect to time. Further improvements will be given in a 
forthcoming paper, including “variable constants” (previously introduced by the main author 
in 1988 in  papers [13] , [14] , [15] , then in 1995 in  reference [9] ).
