D’Agostini G.∗ and Petit J.P.†

(Dated: June 3, 2018)

From our exact solution of the Janus Cosmological equation we derive the relation of the predicted
magnitude of distant sources versus their red shift. The comparison, through this one free parameter
model, to the available data from 740 distant supernovae shows an excellent ﬁt.

INTRODUCTION

• A positive mass object does attract any positive or neg-

Modern cosmology is facing quizzical observational
data. One of them is the acceleration of expansion of
the universe [1–3]. Scientists are then facing two choices:

• They either limit their interpretation of the phe-
nomenon within the geometrical frame issued from the
complete Einsteins ﬁeld equation,
including the so-
called cosmological constant Λ. Therefore the price to
pay for it, is to add the concept of dark energy, whose
physical nature remains a complete mystery. On top of
that, this creates a model with a lot of free parameters
giving it the nature of ad hoc model.

• Or they have to deal with a drastic geometric and
paradigmatic change which extends General Relativity
to a wider model. This very model includes negative
mass and negative energy particles whose physical na-
ture can be described through the dynamic groups the-
ory. These particles are simple copies of our classical
matter and antimatter, with negative mass. Moreover,
such a model, inspired by Andrei Sakharovs ideas, does
explain why we do not observe any primeval antimat-
ter.

ative mass.

• A negative mass object does repel any positive or neg-

If, as an example, we are taking two opposite masses
: the positive one is escaping from the following chasing
negative one. Both are experiencing a uniform accelera-
tion. But the energy is conserved because the negative
mass carries a negative energy.
This unmanageable feature banished negative mass con-
cept during 60 years. But this eﬀect vanishes when
we consider that positive and negative masses follow
diﬀerent geodesic systems, which both derived from
both distinct metric tensor ﬁelds g(+)
µν . These
two are meant to be solution of a coupled ﬁeld equa-
tions system and the JCM brings the solution[6–9].
See S.Hossenfelder[10, 11] for corresponding Langrangian
derivation of such bimetric system.

THE JANUS COSMOLOGICAL MODEL, A

NECESSARY NEW GEOMETRICAL

FRAMEWORK

The corresponding interaction scheme is the following:

• Positive masses do attract each other, though Newtons

The JCM is based on the introduction of negative mass
and negative energy in the cosmological model. As shown
in 1957 by Hermann Bondi[4] and conﬁrmed later by
W.Bonnor[5], the introduction of negative masses in the
GR model produced an unmanageable runaway eﬀect.
This eﬀect comes from the usual way we deal with a par-
ticle embedded in a gravitational ﬁeld where particles
follow the same geodesic whatever positive or negative
their mass would be. As a conclusion, from Einsteins
equation:

• Opposed masses do repel each other, through anti-

THE BENEFIT OF THE JCM MODEL

JCM is not another extra model with a lot of puzzling
components, associated with a subsequent set of free pa-
rameters. Its a model without unknown components.

it is nothing else but an extension of Andrei

Indeed,
Sakaraovs ideas [12–14].
In 1967 Andrei Sakharov gave an explanation of the
observational absence of primeval antimatter (nowadays
there still is no other challenging theory). At the time,
he thought the universe to be composed by two twin uni-
verses, both only linked together via one singularity ori-
gin. Inspired from a CPT symmetry scheme, Sakharov
suggested that :

• The arrow of time would be antiparallel to ours (T-

symmetry).

• It would be enantiomorphic (P-symmetry).

• It would contain antimatter (C-symmetry).

JCM globally follows this above general scheme, but, in-
stead of two distinct universes, we suggest to consider
one single universe corresponding to a manifold M4 with
two metrics. This corresponds to a new, but clear, geo-
metrical framework.
As shown by J.M.Souriau in 1970 [15] T-symmetry goes
with energy and mass inversion, so that the twin uni-
verses content only corresponds to a copy of our parti-
cles (photon, proton, neutron, electron, up to quarks and
their anti), but with negative energy and negative mass
if any.
Negative masses emit negative energy photons, therefore
this matter is invisible to us. It only reveals its presence
through (anti) gravitational eﬀects.
Following A.Sakharov, we can assume that the ratio
of the rate of production of baryon versus antibaryons
would be inverse for the negative population.
So that :

• JCM explains the absence of observation of the so-
called primeval antimatter, opposite to the mainstream
ΛCDM model.

• JCM describes precisely the nature of the invisible
components of the universe, opposite to the main-
stream ΛCDM model.

• In addition, JCM predicts that the antimatter pro-
duced in laboratory will react as the matter with re-
spect to the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth (it will fall).

• Because positive and negative matter are repelling each
other, the negative matter content in the solar system
is almost zero. So, JCM ﬁts the classical relativistic
observations, as presented in former papers[7–9].

• JCM suggests a clear scheme for VLS formation [17]
when the mainstream ΛCDM model seems to struggle
more to give one.

• JCM explains the observed repellent eﬀect due to the
Great Repeller [18]. The measured escape velocities

2

of galaxies are due to the presence of an invisible re-
pellent cluster made of negative mass in the centre of
a big void. The mainstream models supporters sug-
gest that such a repellent eﬀect could be due to some
kind of hole in the dark matter ﬁeld of the universe
(positive masses). But, if the gravitational instability
leads to the setting up of massive clusters, it does not
provide any scheme for such void formations. So that
the mainstream ΛCDM model does not provide any
explanation for this observation.

• JCM explains the conﬁnement of galaxies and their ﬂat
rotation curves, as recently showed by Jamie Farnes
[16], see ﬁg. 1. Mysterious dark matter is no longer
required, while the mainstream ΛCDM model does.

FIG. 1. Circular velocity as a function of radius as extracted
from the N-body simulations

• After JCM, the intensity of the observed gravitational
lensing eﬀect is mainly due to the negative matter that
surrounds galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Mysterious
dark matter is no longer required, while the ΛCDM
model does.

• JCM suggests an explanation of the low magnitude of
very young galaxies: this would be due to negative
lensing weakening, when their light are crossing the
negative mass clusters located at the center of the big
void. Mysterious dark matter is no longer required,
while the ΛCDM model does.

• JCM explains the spiral structure of galaxies[19], see
ﬁg.2, due to dynamical friction with the surrounding
negative mass. The ΛCDM model don’t give any
model explaining the spiral structure.

As a conclusion JCM is deﬁnitively not a simple or pure
speculative product of theoretical mathematics. It had
been compared with observations and happened to ﬁt
with them. Opposite to the todays mainstream ΛCDM
model, JCM does not carry unknown and mystery like
dark matter or dark energy.

Results presented below, show the standardized distance
modulus, linked to experimental parameters through the
relation :

µ = m∗

B − MB + αX1 − βC

where m∗
B is the observed peak magnitude in rest frame
B band, X1 is the time stretching of the light curve and
C the supernova color at maximum brightness.
Both MB , α and β are nuisance parameters in the dis-
tance estimate.
We took the values given in ref.[20] corresponding to the
best ﬁt of the whole set of combined data (740 super-
novae) with ΛCDM model.

With our best ﬁt, we have :χ2/d.o.f. = 657/738

(740 points and 2 parameters).
The corresponding curves are shown in ﬁg. 3, 4, 5, 6,
in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The
comparison with both model best ﬁts are shown in ﬁg. 7.

ture of the universe we supposed that the mass density
of the negative species (negative mass ’twin’ matter) is
much higher that the one of the positive species.
In JCM, we have to take into account two systems, each
owing their own sets of variable constants plus space and
time scale factors :

[c(+), G(+), h(+), m(+), e(+), a(+), t(+)]
[c(−), G(−), h(−), m(−), e(−), a(−), t(−)]

A future work will show how, the system of coupled
ﬁeld equations(1) including a variable constants process,
starting from a fully symmetrical initial situation can ex-
plain density instabilities.
Moreover, when the densities get weaker, the sets :

[c(+), G(+), h(+), m(+), e(+)]
[c(−), G(−), h(−), m(−), e(−)]

The ΛCDM model provides an interpretation of the ﬂuc-

challenge the ΛCDM it must provide an alternative in-
terpretation of such observational data.

ative energy and negative mass, if any. By developping
former Sakharovs theory, it explains the lack of primeval
antimatter observation. The negative sector is then com-
posed with negative mass protons, neutrons, electrons
and so on. Through such a negative energy, photons
make all negative sectors species invisible to us.
JCM model is explaining the strong gravitational lensing
eﬀects around galaxies and clusters of galaxies, due to the
surrounding and conﬁning negative mass environment. It
brings a model for VLS formation, spiral structure and
gives an explanation to the repellent phenomena recently
observed in a very large size mapping. It also explains
the ﬂatness of the rotation curves of galaxies.
The extension of JCM to a variable constants regime,
applying to the early stage, explains the homogeneity of
the early universe.
It brings an exact solution in the dust era, which takes
takes into account the acceleration of the universe. This
paper is willing to demonstrate the good agreement of
this solution with a single free parameter, with the ex-
perimental data on supernovae. The deceleration param-
eter q0, allways negative, happened to be small and there
is no need in JCM to introduce a non zero cosmological
constant to ﬁt the so far available data.
It is also pointed out that the model must now provide
its own interpretation of additional features like the CMB
ﬂuctuations.

In terms of the time t used in the FRLW metric, the
light emitted by Ge at time te is observed on G0 at a
time t0 (te > t0) and the distance l travelled by photons
(ds2 = 0) is related to the time diﬀerence t and then to
the u parameter through the relation :

So we can write :

We need now to link ue and u0 to observable quantities
q0, H0, and z. From Eq. (10) we get :
