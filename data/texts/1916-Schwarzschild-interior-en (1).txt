On the Gravitational Field of a Sphere

of Incompressible Fluid

according to Einstein’s Theory †

by K. Schwarzschild

(Communicated February 24th, 1916 [see above p. 313].)

(Translation‡ by S. Antoci∗)

§1. As a further example of Einstein’s theory of gravitation I have calculated the gravitational
ﬁeld of a homogeneous sphere of ﬁnite radius, which consists of incompressible ﬂuid. The addition
“of incompressible ﬂuid” is necessary, since in the theory of relativity gravitation depends not only
on the quantity of matter, but also on its energy, and e. g. a solid body in a given state of tension
would yield a gravitation diﬀerent from a ﬂuid.

The computation is an immediate extension of my communication on the gravitational ﬁeld of

a mass point (these Sitzungsberichte 1916, p. 189), that I shall quote as “Mass point” for short.

§2. Einstein’s ﬁeld equations of gravitation (these Sitzungsber. 1915, p. 845) read in general:

∂Γα
µν
∂xα

Xα

+Xαβ

Γα
µβΓβ

να = Gµν .

The quantities Gµν vanish where no matter is present. In the interior of an incompressible ﬂuid
they are determined in the following way: the “mixed energy tensor” of an incompressible ﬂuid at
rest is, according to Mr. Einstein (these Sitzungsber. 1914, p. 1062, the P present there vanishes
due to the incompressibility):

T 1

1 = T 2

2 = T 3

3 = −p, T 4

4 = ρ0,

(the remaining T ν

µ = 0).

Here p means the pressure, ρ0 the constant density of the ﬂuid.

The “covariant energy tensor” will be:

Furthermore:

where k2 is Gauss’ gravitational constant. Then according to Mr. Einstein (these Berichte 1915,

must be satisﬁed (ibidem Eq. 7a).

§3. Just as in “Mass point”, also for the sphere the general equations must be specialised to
the case of rotation symmetry around the origin. Like there, it is convenient to introduce the polar
coordinates of determinant 1:

x1 =

, x2 = − cos ϑ, x3 = φ, x4 = t.

r3
3

Then the line element, like there, must have the form:

ds2 = f4dx2

4 − f1dx2

1 − f2

− f2dx2

3(1 − x2

2),

dx2

2

1 − x2

2

hence one has:

g11 = −f1, g22 = −

, g33 = −f2(1 − x2

2), g44 = f4

f2

1 − x2

2

(the remaining gµν = 0).

Moreover the f are functions only of x1.

The solutions (10), (11), (12) reported in that paper hold also for the space outside the sphere:

f4 = 1 − α(3x1 + ρ)−1/3, f2 = (3x1 + ρ)2/3, f1f 2

2 f4 = 1,

(9)

where α and ρ are for now two arbitrary constants, that must be determined afterwards by the
mass and by the radius of our sphere.

It remains the task to establish the ﬁeld equations for the interior of the sphere by means of
the expression (8) of the line element, and to solve them. For the right-hand sides one obtains in
sequence:

T11 = T 1

1 g11 = −pf1, T22 = T 2

2 g22 = −

T33 = T 3

The expressions of the components Γα
µν of the gravitational ﬁeld in terms of the functions f and the
left-hand sides of the ﬁeld equations can be taken without change from “Mass point” (§4). If one
again restricts himself to the equator (x2 = 0), one gets the following overall system of equations:

From the general considerations of Mr. Einstein it turns out that the present 5 equations with the
4 unknown functions f1, f2, f4, p are mutually compatible.

We have to determine a solution of these 5 equations that is free from singularities in the
interior of the sphere. At the surface of the sphere it must be p = 0, and there the functions f
together with their ﬁrst derivatives must reach with continuity the values (9) that hold outside the
sphere.

For simplicity the index 1 of x1 will be henceforth omitted.
§4. By means of the equation for the determinant the equilibrium condition (e) becomes:

We will introduce here new variables, which recommend themselves since, according to the results
of “Mass point”, they behave in a very simple way outside the sphere. Therefore they must bring
also the parts of the present equations free from ρ0 and p to a simple form. One sets:

f2 = η2/3, f4 = ζη−1/3, f1 =

1
ζη

.

Then according to (9) one has outside the sphere:

If one introduces these new variables and substitutes γf −1/2
equations (11) and (12) become:

for ρ0 + p according to (10), the

η = 3x + ρ, ζ = η1/3 − α,

The addition of these two equations gives:

The integrating factor of this equation is ∂η/∂x. The integration gives:

ζ(cid:18) ∂η

∂x(cid:19)2

= 9η1/3 − 3κρ0η + 9λ (λ integration constant).

(18)

When raised to the power 3/2, this gives:

If one divides (17) by this equation, ζ disappears, and it remains the following diﬀerential equation
for η:

Here ∂η/∂x is again the integrating factor. The integration gives:

η1/6dη

(9η1/3 − 3κρ0η + λ)3/2

(19)

and since:

∂x(cid:19)3
ζ 3/2(cid:18) ∂η

= (9η1/3 − 3κρ0η + 9λ)3/2

3κγη1/6

(9η1/3 − 3κρ0η + λ)3/2 .

through a further integration it follows:

x =

18 Z dηZ

η1/6dη

(η1/3 − κρ0

3 η + λ)3/2 .

From here x turns out as function of η, and through inversion η as function of x. Then ζ follows
from (18) and (19), and the functions f through (13). Hence our problem is reduced to quadratures.
§5. The integration constants must now be determined in such a way that the interior of the
sphere remains free from singularities and the continuous junction to the external values of the
functions f and of their derivatives at the surface of the sphere is realised.

Let us put r = ra, x = xa, η = ηa, etc. at the surface of the sphere. The continuity of η and
ζ can always be secured through a subsequent appropriate determination of the constants α and ρ
in (14). In order that also the derivatives stay continuous and, in keeping with (15), (dη/dx)a = 3
and (dζ/dx)a = η−2/3

, according to (16) and (18) it must be:

a

One sees from the comparison with (10) that in this way also the condition p = 0 at the surface is
satisﬁed. The condition (dη/dx)a = 3 yields the following determination for the limits of integration
in (19):

and therefore (20) undergoes the following determination of the limits of integration:

(η1/3 − κρ0

The surface conditions are therefore completely satisﬁed. Still undetermined are the two constants
ηa and λ, which will be ﬁxed through the conditions of continuity at the origin.

We must ﬁrst of all require that for x = 0 it should be also η = 0. If this were not the case,
f2 in the origin would be a ﬁnite quantity, and an angular variation dφ = dx3 in the origin, which
in reality means no motion at all, would give a contribution to the line element. Hence from (24)
follows the condition for ﬁxing ηa:

3xa = ηa −

(η1/3 − κρ0

λ will be ﬁxed at last through the condition that the pressure at the center of the sphere shall
remain ﬁnite and positive, from which according to (10) it follows that there f4 must remain ﬁnite
and diﬀerent from zero. According to (13), (18) and (23) one has:

One provisorily supposes either λ > 0 or λ < 0. Then, for very small η:

where one has set:

f4 =

K = 1 −

3 η + λ)3/2 .

In the center (η = 0) f4 will then be inﬁnite, unless K = 0. But, if K = 0, f4 vanishes for η = 0.
In no case, for η = 0, f4 results ﬁnite and diﬀerent from zero. Hence one sees that the hypothesis:
either λ > 0 or λ < 0, does not bring to physically practicable solutions, and it turns out that it
must be λ = 0.

§6. With the condition λ = 0 all the integration constants are now ﬁxed. At the same time
the integrations to be executed become very easy. If one introduces a new variable χ instead of η
through the deﬁnition:

sinχ = r κρ0

through an elementary calculation the equations (13), (26), (10), (24), (25) transform themselves

When one avails of the variables χ, ϑ, φ instead of x1, x2, x3 (ix), the line element in the interior
of the sphere takes the simple form:

dt2 −

[dχ2 + sin2χdϑ2 + sin2χsin2ϑdφ2].

(35)

Outside the sphere the form of the line element remains the same as in “Mass point”:

ds2 = (1 − α/R)dt2 −

− R2(dϑ2 + sin2 ϑdφ2)

dR2

1 − α/R

(36)

where R3 = r3 + ρ.

Now ρ will be determined by (33), while for the mass point it was ρ = α3.

§7. The following remarks apply to the complete solution of our problem contained in the

previous paragraphs .

1. The spatial line element (dt = 0) in the interior of the sphere reads:

−ds2 =

[dχ2 + sin2χdϑ2 + sin2χsin2ϑdφ2].

3
κρ0

This is the known line element of the so called non Euclidean geometry of the spherical space.
Therefore the geometry of the spherical space holds in the interior of our sphere. The curvature

radius of the spherical space will be p3/κρ0. Our sphere does not constitute the whole spherical

space, but only a part, since χ can not grow up to π/2, but only up to the limit χa. For the Sun
the curvature radius of the spherical space, that rules the geometry in its interior, is about 500
times the radius of the Sun (see formulae (39) and (42)).

That the geometry of the spherical space, that up to now had to be considered as a mere
possibility, requires to be real in the interior of gravitating spheres, is an interesting result of
Einstein’s theory.

Inside the sphere the quantities:

r 3

κρ0

dχ, r 3

κρ0

sinχdϑ, r 3

κρ0

sinχsinϑdφ,

are “naturally measured” lengths. The radius “measured inside” from the center of the sphere up
to its surface is:

The circumference of the sphere, measured along a meridian (or another great circle) and divided
by 2π, is called the radius “measured outside” Po. It turns out to be:

According to the expression (36) of the line element outside the sphere this Po is clearly identical
with the value Ra = (r3

a + ρ)1/3 that the variable R assumes at the surface of the sphere.

With the radius Po one gets for α from (34) the simple relations:

2. About the equations of motion of a point of inﬁnitely small mass outside our sphere, which
maintain tha same form as in “Mass point” (there equations (15)-(17)), one makes the following
remarks:

For large distances the motion of the point occurs according to Newton’s law, with α/2k2
playing the rˆole of the attracting mass. Therefore α/2k2 can be designated as “gravitational mass”
of our sphere.

If one lets a point fall from the rest at inﬁnity down to the surface of the sphere, the “naturally

measured” fall velocity takes the value:

Hence, due to (40):

For the Sun the fall velocity is about 1/500 the velocity of light. One easily satisﬁes himself
that, with the small value thus resulting for χa and χ (< χa), all our equations coincide with the
equations of Newton’s theory apart from the known second order Einstein’s eﬀects.

3. For the ratio between the gravitational mass α/2k2 and the substantial mass M one ﬁnds

va =

p1 − α/R

= r α

Ra

.

va = sinχa.

α

2k2M

=

3

sin3χa

χa − 1

2 sin2χa

.

With the growth of the fall velocity va (= sinχa), the growth of the mass concentration lowers
the ratio between the gravitational mass and the substantial mass. This becomes clear for the fact
that e. g. with constant mass and increasing density one has the transition to a smaller radius
with emission of energy (lowering of the temperature through radiation).

4. The velocity of light in our sphere is

hence it grows from the value 1/cosχa at the surface to the value 2/(3cosχa − 1) at the center. The
value of the pressure quantity ρ0 + p according to (10) and (30) grows in direct proportion to the
velocity of light.

At the center of the sphere (χ = 0) velocity of light and pressure become inﬁnite when cosχa =

1/3, and the fall velocity becomes p8/9 of the (naturally measured) velocity of light. Hence there

is a limit to the concentration, above which a sphere of incompressible ﬂuid can not exist. If one
would apply our equations to values cosχa < 1/3, one would get discontinuities already outside

v =

3cosχa − cosχ

,

(42)

the center of the sphere. One can however ﬁnd solutions of the problem for larger χa, which are
continuous at least outside the center of the sphere, if one goes over to the case of either λ > 0
or λ < 0, and satisﬁes the condition K = 0 (Eq. 27). On the road of these solutions, that are
clearly not physically meaningful, since they give inﬁnite pressure at the center, one can go over to
the limit case of a mass concentrated to one point, and retrieves then the relation ρ = α3, which,
according to the previous study, holds for the mass point. It is further noticed here that one can
speak of a mass point only as far as one avails of the variable r, that otherwise in a surprising way
plays no rˆole for the geometry and for the motion inside our gravitational ﬁeld. For an observer
measuring from outside it follows from (40) that a sphere of given gravitational mass α/2k2 can
not have a radius measured from outside smaller than:

For a sphere of incompressible ﬂuid the limit will be 9/8α. (For the Sun α is equal to 3 km, for a
mass of 1 gram is equal to 1.5 · 10−28 cm.)

Po = α.
