The Janus Cosmological Model is based on a system of two coupled ﬁeld equations.
It explains the nature of dark matter and dark energy with negative mass and without
the runaway paradox that arises in general relativity. We ﬁrst recall how this system
was built, from a simple Newtonian toy model to a relativistic bimetric theory, that is
now improved in order to fulﬁll mathematical constraints and set up on a Lagrangian
derivation.

1 The long genesis of the Janus Cosmological Model
Roots of the Janus Cosmological Model are like assembling
diﬀerent pieces of a puzzle. There are indeed several start-
ing points for this bimetric approach. The ﬁrst is the missing
primordial antimatter, a problem solved in 1967 by Andrei
Sakharov in [1] with the representation of the universe not
as a single entity born from the beginning of time, but two
spacetimes with opposite arrows of time communicating only
through their common initial singularity, forming a “twin uni-
verse” in complete CPT symmetry, as represented in the di-
dactic Figure 1.

Then, the ﬁrst step is to consider that these two entities
can interact gravitationally, which is equivalent to folding the
object of Figure 1 on itself as in Figure 2.

In 1977, a ﬁrst modeling using non relativistic theoret-
ical tools is attempted in [2] and [3] with two Boltzmann
equations coupled with Poisson’s equation. We then realize
Sakharov’s seminal idea of a complete CPT symmetry be-
tween these two entities, an idea also independently used by
other authors recently [4]. Such work suggests that a pro-
found paradigm shift involving geometrical grounds should
be performed.

Early 1990’s, we explore, through computer simulations,
what could emerge from interaction laws associated with a
mix of positive and negative point masses, according to the
following assumption. Interactions laws:

• Like masses attract, according to Newton’s law.

Fig. 2: Sakharov’s model with “conjugate folds”.

• Unlike masses repel, according to “anti-Newton”.
At this stage, it is only a toy model.

In 1992, ﬁrst 2D
simulations of two populations with opposite mass and same
absolute value of density show a separation of the two enti-
ties, as shown in [5], a result reproduced below in Figure 3.

The purpose was to account for the large-scale structure
of the universe, which admittedly wasn’t a tight ﬁt with these
early experiments. But if we now introduce asymmetry in the
two mass densities, taking a greater density for the negative
mass species, then this population has a shorter Jeans time,
hence it is the ﬁrst to coalesce into conglomerates, by gravi-
tational instability.

Following simulations conﬁrm this second hypothesis as
they produce an evolution of the positive mass distribution
into a large-scale structure with big negative mass conglom-
erates (optically invisible) repelling the positive mass matter
in the remnant space around them as shown in [6], a deci-
sive result reproduced below in Figure 4, this time in very
good agreement with the observation of the lacunar, foam-

like structure of the universe, where galaxies, clusters and
superclusters are organized as a web of ﬁlaments, walls and
nodes distributed around giant repulsive cosmic voids.

Same approach but diﬀerent boundary conditions in [7],

reproduced in Figure 5.

Such a scenario also produces, in 3D, a mechanism help-
ing galaxy formation along. Indeed, after recombination, if
large volumes of gas can coalesce into giant conglomerates,
then a problem arises: how to dissipate such enormous gravi-
tational energy transformed into heat? Considering an object
of radius R, the amount of energy collected varies according
to R3 while the surface of the heatsink varies as R2. There-
fore, larger masses have a more important cooling time. But
the constitution of the large-scale structure suggested by these
simulations leads to a compression of the positive mass which
distributes according to walls (as observed) that are actually
sandwiched between two repulsive conglomerates of nega-
tive mass. A strong compression of the positive mass occurs
in such planar structures, which are optimal for a quick radia-
tive dissipation of energy, as explained in [6].

Besides 2D simulations, an eﬀective conﬁnement of
galaxies despite their high peripheral velocity is analytically
demonstrated using an exact solution of two Vlasov equations
coupled with Poisson’s equation, using the methodology ex-
posed in [5]. The ﬂat rotation curve obtained from such a so-
lution, made possible by the repulsive eﬀect of the surround-
ing negative mass, has been shown for the ﬁrst time in [6],
a curve reproduced in Figure 6. It is worth noting that such
a typical rotation curve has been similarly obtained more re-
cently using the same repulsive action of a negative mass dis-
tribution around galaxies, but from 3D computer simulations
made by an independent researcher [8].

Using the exact solution of the analytical set of two
Vlasov equations coupled with Poisson’s equation (image of
a 2D galaxy conﬁned by a repulsive negative mass environ-
ment), we show in numerical simulations that the rotational
motion of the galaxy generates a good-looking barred spiral
structure in a few turns (1992 DESY results, published in [6]
and [7]).

In order to progress beyond a simple toy model that opens
up interesting prospects thanks to the various above-men-
tioned positive results, it was still necessary at that time to
derive interaction laws from a coherent mathematical formal-
ism. The introduction of negative mass in cosmology had
been considered as soon as the 1950s, using general relativ-
ity, deﬁned by the well-known Einstein ﬁeld equations which
may be written, with a zero cosmological constant:

Rµν − 1
2

R gµν = +χTµν.

(2)

Let’s notice that Einstein’s equation describes the motion
of point masses embedded in a given mass-energy ﬁeld Tµν
along geodesics that derive from a single metric gµν . Then,
one gets Bondi’s result from [9]. Interaction laws with a sin-
gle metric:

• Positive masses attract everything.
• Negative masses repel everything.

Which inevitably produce the preposterous “runaway
motion” paradox (see Figure 8), a term coined by Bonnor
in [10].

Nonetheless, a few authors (Farnes [8], Chardin [11]) still
consider that it is possible to introduce negative mass in cos-
mology keeping the general relativity framework, hence
putting up with such phenomenon; despite the fact that the
runaway motion has been associated with the possibility of
perpetual motion machines since the 1950s, as discussed by
Gold with Bondi, Bergmann and Pirani in [12].

On the contrary, from 1995 in [13] we propose a bimet-
ric description of the universe with two coupled metrics and
which produce trajectories along their own geodesics, for
positive and negative mass particles, respectively. Then, the
classical Schwarzschild solution allows, by simply reversing
the integration constant, to get trajectories suggesting a grav-
itational repulsion of positive masses by a negative mass, and
vice versa:

Fig. 5: Result of a 2D large-scale structure simulation on a 2-sphere [7].

Exploiting this idea, we introduce the concept of negative (di-
verging) gravitational lensing in the same paper [13]. Consid-
ering that a gap within a negative mass distribution is equiv-
alent to a positive mass concentration, we suggest to attribute
the strong gravitational lensing eﬀects, observed in the vicin-
ity of galaxies and galaxy clusters, not to a dark matter halo
made of positive mass, but instead to their negative mass en-
vironment.

From 1994, we also suggest in [5] that such a bimet-
ric description could result from the combination of two La-
grangian densities, due to two Ricci scalars R(+) and R(−). In
2001 [6], we proposed for the ﬁrst time a system of two cou-
pled ﬁeld equations, which can be written as:

nian approximation of this system of two coupled equations.
Depending locally on the type of dominant species in a given
region of space, equations with no RHS produce solutions of
type 36 or 37.

Aforementioned results of simulations showed that an
asymmetry in the mass densities of the positive vs negative
mass species is required to account for observations of the
large-scale structure of the universe. Such density asymme-
try can be caused, not because of a larger quantity of neg-
ative mass, but if the two space gauge factors a(+) and a(−)
are diﬀerent. Alas, at this level it is impossible to produce a
time-dependent solution with a(+) (cid:44) a(−). Inconsistency be-
comes inevitable when FRLW metrics are introduced in the
two ﬁeld equations: similarly to Friedmann solutions, they
produce a couple of diﬀerential equations in a(+), a(cid:48)(+), a”(+)
on one hand, and in a(−), a(cid:48)(−), a”(−) on the other. In the calcu-
lation based on Einstein’s equations, compatibility betweeen
two equations leads to the relation ρ a3 = cst in the matter-
dominated era, which expresses mass-energy conservation.
In the bimetric framework of the Janus model based on the

two coupled equations 5 and 6, such compatibility reduces
the time-dependent solution to a(+) = a(−).

Still in the same 2001 paper [6], we establish the connec-
tion between Sakharov’s seminal work about two universes
with opposite arrows of time, and negative gravity, using dy-
namical group theory from [14], which shows that time re-
versal goes with energy inversion, hence mass inversion as
−m = − E/c2. We then introduce the “Janus group” to han-
dle the electric charge in a ﬁve-dimensional spacetime:

where L0 is the component of the orthochronous (forward in
time) subset of the Lorentz group. It is the extension of the
Poincar´e group to ﬁve dimensions, which describes the ex-
istence of two diﬀerent kinds of antimatter: one being C-
symmetric with respect to normal matter, it has a positive
mass; while the other antichronous (backward in time) an-
timatter is PT-symmetric and has a negative mass. Therefore,

the CPT theorem has to be reconsidered, since the exclusion
of negative energy states follows on from an a priori axiom in
quantum ﬁeld theory, which postulates that the operator T has
to be antiunitary and antilinear, a hypothesis not necessarily
true as shown in [15].

Sakharov’s conditions in [1] states that the baryon cre-
ation rate from an excess of quarks has been faster than the
antibaryon creation rate from fewer antiquarks at t > 0, but
such CP violation is opposite for t < 0 (the “initial singular-
ity” triggering complete CPT reﬂections) thereby preserving
the global symmetry of the whole universe. This allows to de-
ﬁne the true nature of the invisible antichronous components
of the universe: these are copies of antiparticles that are usu-
ally made in a lab, but with negative energy and mass, due to
T-symmetry.

The invisibility of such objects is deduced from the idea that
PT-symmetric antiparticles emit negative energy photons that
follow null-geodesics of their own metric g(−)
µν hence escape
detection by optical instruments that are made of positive
mass matter.

In 2002, Damour and Kogan in [16] situate the issue with
massive bigravity theories, where bimetry covers a diﬀerent
approach. In such models, two branes interact using various
massive gravitons (hence the name) with a mass spectrum.
The authors propose a Lagrangian derivation, based on an ac-
tion, which leads to a system of two coupled ﬁeld equations.
But such a model, although mathematically consistent, does
not stand up to scrutiny as it does not provide any solution
able to be confronted with observations. As it has not been
further pursued, it cannot answer this question.

(cid:112)

On the other hand, in 2008 and 2009, Hossenfelder in [17]
and [18] builds her own bimetric model involving negative
mass, from a Lagrangian derivation where she produces a
system of two coupled ﬁeld equations. This time, LHS are
identical to the system (5;6) which follows on from the pres-
g(−) in the Lagrangian den-
sities considered. Exploiting her Lagrangian derivation, she
g(+)/g(−)
reveals the determinant ratios of the two metrics
g(−)/g(+) that had already been pointed out in previous
and
work [19] and [20]. She ﬁnally tackles two Friedmann solu-
tions, without confronting them to observational data. Actu-
ally, although sharing many similarities, having the same kind
of coupled ﬁeld equations regarding negative mass, a funda-
mental diﬀerence remains between Hossenfelder’s bimetric
theory and the Janus Cosmological Model.

(cid:112)

Indeed, Hossenfelder doubts that the second entity can
have an important eﬀect on the distribution of standard mat-
ter, qualifying the gravitational coupling between the two
species as “extremely weak”. This is because “for symme-
try reason” she considers that the absolute values of the mass
density of the two populations should be of the same order
of magnitude. Such hypothesis leads to a global zero ﬁeld

conﬁguration, which does not ﬁt with observations, as she
notices. Then, examination of possible ﬂuctuations seems to
be her main concern. Not perceiving that a profound dissym-
metry is on the contrary the key to the interpretation of many
phenomena, including the acceleration of the cosmic expan-
sion, she will not develop her model further during the fol-
lowing decade, focusing instead on other research topics.

Nonetheless, Hossenfelder points out a “smoking gun sig-
nal” that could highlight the existence of invisible negative
mass in the universe, through the detection of diﬀracted light
rays caused by diverging lensing, an eﬀect previously pre-
dicted in [13]. We indeed showed from 1995 that photons
emitted by high redshift galaxies (z > 7) are diﬀracted by the
presence of invisible conglomerates of negative mass on their
path. This reduces the apparent magnitude of such galaxies,
making them appear as dwarf, which is consistent with obser-
vations.

In 2014 in [21] we take again the system (5;6) and attempt

to modify it according to:

the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. D’Agostini
thereafter showed in 2018 in [22] that this exact solution is in

allel we published in 2014 in [23] a Lagrangian derivation
based on the functional relation:

which is similar to Hossenfelder’s system in her previous La-
grangian derivation [18], although both constructions are
completely diﬀerent.
In our derivation, the square root in
the determinant ratio of the metrics directly follows on from
hypothesis (14). Let’s recall that such a ratio always ap-
pears as soon as a bimetric approach is attempted, see for
example [19] and [20]. Admittedly however, we cannot rule
out that the system (15);(16), as well as the newer one ex-
posed hereinbelow, can be considered as a particular case of
Hossenfelder’s own model.

In 2014 in [23] we extend the Janus framework to a class
of solutions where the two speeds of light and, in the positive
and negative sectors, are diﬀerent. In 2018 in [25] we pro-
pose to evaluate the magnitude of their ratio, based on a study
of the ﬂuctuations in the CMB, which leads to the following
conclusion:

The combination of such diﬀerent space scale factors and
speeds of light would allow a gain factor of 1000 in travel
time, regarding a hypothetical technology making apparent
FTL interstellar travel by mass inversion possible, as evoked
in [23] and [26].

The paper [23] then summarizes many observational data
in good agreement with features of the Janus Cosmological
Model.

2 The 2014 JCM and the Bianchi identities
From 2014, the Janus system of two coupled ﬁeld equations
(13; 14) satisﬁes the Bianchi identities, either trivially when
the RHS are zero, or when one considers time-dependent ho-
mogeneous and isotropic solutions. However, inconsistency
appears when one tries to describe with this system a time-
independent situation with a spherical symmetry, modeling
a star of constant density surrounded by a vacuum. Thus, a
new modiﬁcation of the equation system must be considered,
as explained below.

Let’s consider a portion of the universe where one of the
two species is absent, e.g.
the negative energy species, re-
pelled away by a local concentration of positive mass. Let’s
limit our analysis to the search of a time-independent solution
for a spherically symmetric system, and Newtonian approxi-
mation. The corresponding system is:

where p(+) is the pressure insides the star of radius rs ﬁlled
with constant density ρ(+). Equations (16) and (17) give the
following diﬀerential equations:

After Newtonian approximation:

So that we get a physical and mathematical contradiction,

that must be cured.

lowing bivariation, taking account of Iϕ = ϕ and ϕϕ = I,
results in equations 32–35.

From a previous Lagrangian derivation [7] :

δg(−)µν = −δg(+)µν

Our goal: to set up a system of two coupled ﬁeld equa-
tions providing joint solutions corresponding to Newtonian
approximation.
In such conditions the external metrics are
given in equations (36) and (37).
We may consider that such metrics belong to subsets of
Riemannian metrics with signature (+−−−) which obey rela-
tionship (39) (see eqs. (38)). If we consider that (39) deﬁnes
joint metrics, they obey:

Starting from the new joint system (40);(41) we obtain the
analogous of the system (16);(17) where, in the second equa-
tion, we would replace the tensor T (+) g(+)

With the joint metrics (18) and (19), inside the star, plus
compatibility conditions satisfying (20) and (21) at its border

6 Conclusion
A model is never deﬁnitively ﬁxed in time. The set of two
coupled ﬁeld equations ﬁrst established in [9] corresponded
to a ﬁrst step. The present paper proposes an updated sys-
tem that has been mathematically enriched to give a precise
description of the matter-dominated era. In its Newtonian ap-
proximation, it provides a new insight on astrophysics, espe-
cially in galactic dynamics which no longer depends on a set
of a single Vlasov equation plus Poisson but on two Vlasov
equations coupled with Poisson’s equation. New results in
that ﬁeld will be published soon.

To a model already compliant with many observational
data [22], a physically and mathematically coherent repre-
sentation of joint geometries for positive energy and mass
species, in the solar system and its neighborhood, has been
added. Therefore, the Janus cosmological model agrees with
classical veriﬁcations of general relativity.

By reversing this situation, considering instead a portion
of space where negative mass largely dominates locally, i.e.
where positive mass has been repelled away so its mass den-
sity can be taken equal to zero, we obtain the ﬁrst coherent
theoretical description of the Great Repeller, which has been
exposed in [26].

When photons emitted by high redshift galaxies (z>7)
cross negative mass conglomerates in the center of big cos-
mic voids, in the large-scale structure of the universe, neg-
ative gravitational lensing reduces their apparent magnitude,
making them appear as dwarf galaxies, which is consistent
with observations.

One may argue that the Janus theory exhibiting tow cou-
pled metrics as a “natural” hypothesis with the conﬁdence
that subsequent results would eventually corroborate the pos-
tulate. However this bimetric model is formally sustained by
a speciﬁc splitting of the Riemann Tensor which yields to 2nd
rank tensor ﬁeld equations, as shown in [27].
