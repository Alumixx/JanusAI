Notations	

	
In	this	paper,	we	use	the	Lie	algebra	of	the	dual	Poincaré	dynamical	group	which	when	
acted	upon	by	its	coadjoint	,	displays	energy,	momentum	and	spin	as	pure	geometrical	
quantities.	When	extended	to	the	full	group,	one	obtains	negative	mass	species	in	
accordance	with	our	Janus	Cosmologial	Model	and	the	twin	universe	model	conjectured	
by	A.Sakharov.		
Within	a	5D	Kaluza	Space,	the	theory	leads	to	a	new	matter/antimatter	duality,	implying	
negative	energy	photons	emitted	on	the	negative	domain	of	the	twin	Universe.	This	
account	for	the	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	which	are	thereof	impossible	to	detect	in	
our	domain.	
Finally,	we	show	that	shifting	to	a	Hermitean	space-time	with	an	associated	dynamic	
group	yields	imaginary	energy,	imaginary	mass	and	imaginary	charges	all	imbeded	in	a	
symplectic	(complex)	framework	which	remains	open	to	wide	inverstigations.

Symplectic	geometry	relies	on	symplectic	manifolds.	They	are	said	symplectic	when	they	
are	endowed	with	a	symplectic	form	that	allows	the	measurement	of	sizes	of	2-
dimensional	objects.	In		Riemanian	geometry,	the	metric	tensor	probes	lengths	and	
angles,	whereas	the	sympectif	form	measures	areas.		
The	term	sympletic	was	first	coined	by	H.Weyl	in	1939	as	a	substitute	to	rather	
confusing	(line)	complex	groups	and/or	Abelian	linear	groups.		
The	relativistic	Symplectic	Mechanics	[1]	was	primarly	developped	by	the	french	
mathematician	J.M.Souriau	from	dynamic	groups	theory.		
It	provides	a	new	definition	of	energy,	momentum	and	spin	only	in	terms	of	pure	
geometrical	quantities.	This	arises	from	two	objects	:	 n-dimensional	space	and	its	
isometry	group.

1	–	The	Janus	Cosmological	Model		
The	main	mathematical	tool	is	the	so-called	«	momentum	map	»	which	is	inferred	from	
the	coadjoint	action	of	the	group	on	its	 Lie	 algebra	(the	 coadjoint	 of	 the	 Lie	
representation	is	the	dual	of	the	adjoint	representation).		
Applying	the	technique	of	this	coadjoint	action	leads	to	the	appearence	of	generalized	
linear	and	angular	momenta	:	   Energy E , 3− momentum p , spin s
The	action	corresponds	to	:		
																																																		  M ' = L M tL + N tP tL − L P tN																																																		(1)	
																																																																							P’	=	L	P																																																																												(2)	
Where	P	is	the	energy-impulsion	4-vector	:	
																																																																									(3)	
																																																																			 
	
L	is	the	element	of	the	Lorentz	group	and	N	the	boost	4-vector	.			
In	the	classical	treatment,	one	merely	considers	the	restricted	Poincaré	group	which	is	
formed	with	the	orthochronous	components	Lo	.	Hence	the	full	Poincaré	Group	can	be	
written	as		
																																																																											
⎟																																																																(4)	
with	 λ= ± 1		
We	then	obtain	two	kinds	of	matters	and	two	kinds	of	photons	which	each	an	opposite	
mass	and	energy.	This	copes	with	the	Janus	Cosmological	Model	(JCM)	we	developped	
earlier		([2],	[3],	[4]).		
Such	a	model	involves	particles	ith	opposite	masses	and	energy.		
However	as	shown	by	H.Bondi	in	1957	[5],	the	field	equation	cannot	sustain	this	duality	
due	to	the	subsequent	and	unmanageable	«	runaway	effect	».	In	short	General	Relativity	
deals	with	positive	masss	that	are	attractive,	while	negative	masses	woud	exhibit	
repelling	forces.		
The	issue	can	be	evaded		by	cinsidering	a	bi-metric	(our	JCModel)	with	a	single	manifold		
M4	equipped	with	two	metric	tensors	  
(−),	which	define	two	field	equations	:

whose	time-independent	and	time-dependent	solutions	fit	observational	data.		
	
We	now	turn	to	a	possible	extension	of	the	group	to	a	five	dimensional	scheme	so	as	to	
obtain	an	isometry	group	which	acts	on	a	Kaluza	space-time	:		
																																																														(7)	
																																																																		  
with		 λ= ± 1	and	 µ= ± 1	
By	extension	to	the	fifth	dimension,	the	Noether	theorem	indices	an	additional	conserved	
scalar	quantity	which	can	be	identified	to	the	electric	charge	q.		
	 µ= − 1	implies	the	inversion	of	the	fifth	dimension,	which	is	just	the	geometrical	
expression	of	the	matter-antimatter	duality,	as	firstly	presented	by	J.M.Souriau	in	
1964[6]			.		
Therefore	the	physics	ruled	by	the	dynamical	group	(7)	exhibits	straightforwardly	the	
matter-antimatter	symmetry	in	the	two	sectors,	with	opposite	mass	and	energy.		
If	we	now	add	p-Kaluza	like	dimensions,	we	obtain	the	metric	under	the	form	:

The	electric	charge	is	one	of	the	quantum	charges.	Here	again		 µ= − 1		reflects	the	C-
symmetry	:	they	account	for	the	classical	matter-antimatter	representation.		
	  λ= −1 ; µ= −1
)	correspond	to	the	PT	symmetry,	classically	associated	to	the	so-called	
identified	 to	 the	 «	C-symmetrical	
«	Feynman	 Antimatter	»,	 which	
antimatter	»,	that	we	could	call	the	«	Dirac-antimatter	».	This	is	due	to	the	presence	of	
the	(real)	time	reversal	operator	T		inducing	both	time,	mass	and	energy	inversions.		
In	other	words	the	group	representation	(9),	which	is	the	basis	of	the	JCModel,	provides	
two	distinct	types	of	antimatters	:		
-  The	C-symmetrical	type,	corresponding	to	Dirac’s	antimatter	
	
-  The	PT-symmetrical	type,	corresponding	to	Feynman’s	antimatter	
	4.	Remark	about	Andrei	Sakharov	schema		[7]			
In	classical	cosmology	a	severe	problem	remains,	due	to	the	absence	of	observation	od	
primeval	antimatter.	In	1967	A.Sakharov	suggested	the	Universe	comprises	two	
domains	:	the	actual	Universe	and	its	twin	Universe,	each	connected	through	a	
singularity	([8]	,	[9],	[10]	),	the	two	being	CPT-symmetrical.	Both	are	CPT-symmetrical.		
Since	the	mass	inversion	goes	with	T-symmetry	,	our	JC-Model	.	([3]	,[4])	corresponds	to	
such	CPT-symmetry.	The	so-called	twin	matter	becomes	nothing	but	a	copy	of	ordinary	
particles,	with	opposite	mass	and	energy.		
If,	as	suggested	by	A.Sakharov,	poitive	passes	are	synthetized	by	positive	energy	quarks	
faster	the	the	synthesis	of	negative	mass	matter	ftom	positive	energy	antiquarks,	then,	
in	the	positive	sector	we	find	:		
-  Remnant	positive	mass	matter	
-  The	equivalent	(ration	3/1)	of	positive	energy	antiquarks	
-  Positive	energy	photons.		
	In	analogy	to	Sakharov’s	idea	the	negative	energy	domain	would	be	composed	by	:		
	
-  Remnant	negative	mass	antimatter	
-  The	equivalent	(ration	3/1)	of	negative	energy	quarks	
-  Negative	energy	photons.		
	As	shown	in	([3],[4])	the	negative	material	suitably	replaces	both	dark	matter	and	so-
called	dark	energy.	Accordingly,	emitting	negative	energy	photons	the	remnant	negative	
mass	antimatter	is	geniusly	invisible.

5.	Remark	about	the	Quantum	Theory	of	Fields	[7]			
In	QFT	the	time	reversal	operator	is	a	complex	operator	which	can	be	linear	and	unitary,	
as	well	as	 antilinear	and	 anti-unitary.	If	chosen	as	linear	and	unitary	this	operator	
implies	the	existence	of	negative	energy	states,	which	is	 a	 priori	banned	by	QFT.	In	
Weinberg	[7]		we	quote	:	«	In	order	to	avoid	this	disastrous	conclusion	we	are	forced	to	
conclude	that	T	is	antilinear	and	anti-unitary	».		
On	page	104	Weinberg	also	writes	that	«	No	examples	are	known	of	particles	that	furnish	
here	».		
Actually,	thi	was	true	until	the	discovery	of	the	acceleration	of	the	expanding	Universe	
which	implies	the	action	of	a	negative	pressure.		
Aa	a	pressure	is	linkened	to	an	energy	density,	this	new	phenomenon	implies	the	
existence	of	negative	energy	states	and	as	a	result	it	questions	QFT	by	itself.	In	the	same	
manner,	it	also	raises	some	questions	as	to	the	validity	of	the	so-called	CPT	theorem	and	
the	vacuum	instability.	Classically	one	considers	that	a	particle	may	loose	energy	by	the	
emission	of	a	photon,	so	that	such	phenomenon	would	lead	to	negative	energy	states.	
But	if	we	consider	that	a	negative	mass	particle	emits	negative	energy	photons,	that	
leads	to	stable	zero	energy	state.		
	6.	Extension	of	the	method	to	a	complex	field.				
In	one	replaces	the	Minkowski	coordinates	   xo , x1 , x2 , x3
}	with	complex	coordinates	
we	may	form	the	Hermitean	Riemann	metric	:		
																																													  ds2 = dxo * dxo − dx1 * dx1 − dx2 * dx2 − dx3 * dx3																										(10)	
The	metric	is	defined	on	a	Hermitean	manifold		
Let	us	now	consider	the	real	matrix	G	:		
																																																											(11)	
																																																																	 
an	the	complex	Lorentz	group	defined	as	:		
																																																																											  *LG L = G																																																																		(12)	
  *L	stands	for	the	adjoint	of	L	.		
One	can	easily	show	that	the		complex	Poincaré	group

framework,	by	simply	substititing	the	matrices	  *A	to	the	transposed	matrices		 t A	.

existence	of	purely	real	masses	 ± m	and	purely	imaginary	masses	  ± (−1)

At	the	same	time,	such	mases	can	exchange	imaginary	photons,	whose	energies	are

features,	namely	energy,	momenta	and	spin.		
When	extended	to	higher	dimensions	it	provides	a	geometrical	interpretation	of	the	
matter-antimatter	duality.		
In	addition,	one	can	notice	that	the	complex	approach	of	space	definition	yields	complex	
physical	quantities.		
The	physical	meaning	of	such	complex	quantities	should	demand	further	scrutiny	and	as
