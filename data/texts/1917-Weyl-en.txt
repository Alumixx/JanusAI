problems as can be dealt with considering our rather fragmentary knowledge
of matter today.
§ 2. The energy-momentum balance expresses quite generally the fact
that the H a m i l t o nian principle is valid for variations of the state vari-
ables that are brought about by an inﬁnitesimal deformation of the four-
dimensional world continuum if the state variables are “carried along” by
the deformation.
§ 3. Principal deliberations regarding the connexion between theory and
observation. Derivation of F e r m a t’s principle of fastest arrivals for light
rays in the static gravitational ﬁeld and of an analogous principle for the
trajectory of a point mass endowed with charge under the inﬂuence of grav-
itation and electricity.

§ 4. Simple derivation of the S c h w a r z s c h i l d solution for a point mass
and transformation to another co¨ordinate system that is important for what
follows. Electrostatic and gravitational ﬁelds of a charged point mass.
§ 5. The construction of a special co¨ordinate system, the uniquely deter-
mined “canonical cylindrical co¨ordinates”, allows for the determination of the
ﬁeld of rotationally distributed masses at rest as simply as in N e w t o nian
theory; there exists a general connexion between the N e w t o nian and
E i n s t e i nian solutions, expressible with the use of elementary functions.
§ 6. An analogue is valid for the electrostatic and gravitational ﬁelds of
rotationally symetrically distributed charges. The deviations from classical
theory are extremely small even at the length scale of atoms.

A. Additions to the General Theory

§ 1. A Hamiltonian principle

The gravitational equations have been reduced to a H a m i l t o nian principle
by H i l b e r t1, based on M i e’s theory2, more generally by H . A . L o r e n t z3
and by the founder of the theory of gravitation himself4.
Its deﬁnitive
formulation fails though, since we do not know the H a m i l t o nian func-
tion (world density of the action) for the matter, indeed do not even know
which independent state variables should be used to describe the matter.
Under these circumstances, it seems of importance to me to formulate a
H a m i l t o nian principle that is suﬃciently broad so as to encompass our
current sound knowledge of matter (in E i n s t e i n’s broad sense, i.e. knowl-
edge of the energy-momentum tensor). From this principle, which will diﬀer
somewhat in form from those that have been presented hitherto, the following
laws should thus emerge, as though from a common source:

1. The inhomogeneous gravitational equations according to which the
In this
energy-momentum tensor determines the curvature of the world.
context, the energy-momentum tensor will be comprised only of that valid for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the æther and of the “kinetic” energy-momentum
tensor of the matter in the more restricted sense (cid:2)uiuk, in which the invariant
mass-density (cid:2) and the components ui (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) of the four-velocity
appear. Here no account is thus taken of the still unclear constitution of
important attributes of matter and of its cohesional forces;

2. the M a x w e l l - L o r e n t z equations, that, as in electron theory, gain
a concrete meaning from the fact that a convectional current appears as the
only electron current;

3. the law for ponderomotive forces in the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the
mechanical equations, which determine the motion of masses under the in-
ﬂuence of these forces and of the gravitational ﬁeld.

In this phenomenological theory, in addition to the “ﬁeld”, the “sub-
stance” arises, a three-dimensional, moving continuum that we can consider
(mathematically) to be divided up into inﬁnitesimal elements. Each element
is endowed with a certain, unchanging mass or “mass charge” dm and an un-
changing electric charge de; as a representation of its history, a certain world

6Every quadratic form can be transformed linearly to a sum and diﬀerence of squares;
the number of negative terms that arise is called the index of inertia. The fact that this
is uniquely determined by the form is precisely the statement of the “law of inertia for
quadratic forms”.

that the motion of the substance is related to the gravitational ﬁeld such
that the square root, i.e. the proper time ds, appearing in the inner integral,
is always positive. We convert (2), which is possible, into an integral

The H a m i l t o nian principle reads:

The sum of the ﬁeld and substance actions of gravitation and electricity
is an extremum in every world domain with respect to arbitrary variations
in the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds that vanish at the boundaries
and with respect to analogous space-time variations of the moving substance
elements.8

Variation of gik (with a ﬁxed electromagnetic ﬁeld and ﬁxed world lines
of the substance) yields the E i n s t e i n gravitational equations (I), variation

These laws are, of course, not independent of each other. In fact, the mechan-
ical equations (III) together with the equation of continuity for the matter
are a mathematical consequence of laws (I) and (II), as can be veriﬁed by a
simple calculation.

§ 2. Energy-momentum balance

According to the authors cited above — we return from the aforementioned
phenomenological theory to a strict one, which can today, granted, only be
formulated in general terms — the world is ruled by an action principle of
the following form

(H − M ) dω = extremum.

(cid:2)

G

Here, the world density M of the action associated with the material processes
is a universal function of the independent state variables characterizing these
processes, their derivatives (ﬁrst, perhaps also higher ones) with respect to
the co¨ordinates xi, and of gik. To refer to a concrete example, M depends,
in M i e’s theory, not only on gik, but also on the four components ϕi of the
electromagnetic potential and on the ﬁeld components Fik that result from
ϕi via diﬀerentiation. The derivation of the mechanical equations in the
phenomenological theory mentioned above suggested to me that perhaps in
general the principle of conservation of energy and momentum expresses the
fact that the H a m i l t o nian principle is obeyed by precisely those inﬁnitely
small variations that are brought about by an inﬁnitesimal deformation of the
world such that the state variables are “carried along” by this deformation.
This is indeed the case and it seems to lead to the simplest and most natural
derivation for the principle of energy.

the equation for the total diﬀerential of M:

where (δM)0 collects the terms containing the diﬀerentials of the material
state variables linearly (e.g. of ϕi and Fik). The contravariant term gik trans-

according to the equations

¯xi = ¯xi(x1, x2, x3, x4)

If this transformation is inﬁnitesimal:

¯xi = ¯xi + ε · ξi(x1, x2, x3, x4)

(ε denotes the inﬁnitesimal constant, i.e. tending to zero), then for the dif-
ference of gik and ¯gik

¯gik(¯x) − gik(x) = δgik,

with the arguments (x) and (¯x) referring to the same world point in the old
and new co¨ordinate systems, one ﬁnds the equation

.

Applying the same procedure to the state variables of the material processes
and making use of the fact that the invariant M remains unchanged under
such an inﬁnitesimal transformation, we obtain the law governing how the
energy-momentum tensor depends on gik and the material state variables.

Consider a world domain G that, when represented by the co¨ordinates
xi, corresponds to a mathematical domain X in the domain of deﬁnition
of these co¨ordinates xi.
If the above inﬁnitesimal transformation has the
property that the variations ξi together with with their derivatives vanish at
the boundary of the domain G, then this world domain in the new variables
¯xi corresponds exactly to the same mathematical domain X. I set

Δgik = ¯gik(x) − gik(x) = δgik +

thus remain true when we switch over from the functions ϕi, Fik to the

variation Δ (in contrast to the variation δ). According to the general action
principle in which we leave gik unchanged, i.e. due to the laws of the material
processes, one has

If we apply the above considerations to H instead of M (the fact that H also

replacing Tik by the tensor

The energy momentum balance is thus not only a mathematical consequence
of the material processes, as we have just shown, but also of the gravitational
equations

What takes place in E i n s t e i n’s theory of the old classiﬁcation into geom-
etry, mechanics and physics, is the juxtaposition of material processes and
gravitation. Mechanics is the eliminant of the two, if you will; for the ex-
istence of the energy-momentum balance is on the one hand a consequence
of the laws for material processes, on the other hand , it is the necessary
condition for the matter to be able to imprint a metric on the world in accor-
dance with the law of gravity. Hence there are four extra equations contained
in the system of material and gravitational laws; indeed there must be four
arbitrary functions in the general solution, since the equations, because of
their invariant nature, leave the co¨ordinate system of the xi completely un-
determined.9

§ 3. Connexion with observation. Light rays and trajectories in

the static gravitational ﬁeld

The “objective” world that physics strives to distil out of our immediately
experienced reality – its testable content – can only be grasped using mathe-
matical concepts. However, to characterize the meaning this system of math-
ematical concepts has as applied to reality, we somehow have to attempt to
describe its connexion to the immediately tangible, a task for epistemology,
which, of its very nature, cannot be accomplished with concepts from physics
alone, but by a constant reference to that which is vividly experienced in the
mind. The connexion between the frequency of an electromagnetic ﬁeld and
the sensory perception “colour” is, for example, of this sort. Quite generally,
it seems that it is the intensity of the energy-momentum current striking the
sensory epithelium that is primarily responsible for the corresponding inten-
sity of perception and the nature of the space-time variability for its quality.
Here I want to describe in more detail this connexion for a rather simpliﬁed
relationship between subject and object.

Imagine that we are in the four-dimensional physical world of single,
moving point masses, which emit light – the stars. For simplicity, we use
geometrical optics according to which the world lines of the light signals
emitted from the stars are singular geodesic lines. In general, the equations
of a geodesic world line read

(4)

where s is an appropriate parameter. It follows that

= constant.

The singular geodesic world lines are deﬁned by the fact that for them in
particular this constant is zero (while it is positive for the world line of point
masses). We simplify the perceiving consciousness, the “monad”, to a “point
eye”. At every moment of its life, it occupies a certain point of space-time, it
traces out a world line; it perceives the points of this world line as following
one another in “temporal succession”. We consider a certain moment; let the
gravitational potentials have the values gik a the point P occupied by the
monad at this given moment; let dxi be the components of the element e of

9

123

Republication of: On the theory of gravitation

789

its world line at that point and the ratios of the dxi describe the world line’s
direction (velocity). We must assume that the direction is time-like, i.e. that

holds. Instead of the diﬀerentials dxi, I write xi from now on, since all of our
considerations refer to the point P .

Two line elements xi, xi

are called orthogonal when

(cid:2)

ds2 = gik dxi dxk > 0

(cid:2)

gikxixk

= 0

holds.
I now claim that all line elements (originating in P ) that are or-
thogonal to the time-like e are themselves space-like. That is, they span an
inﬁnitesimal, three-dimensional domain R upon which the form −ds2 im-
prints a positive deﬁnite metric. The monad experiences this domain R as
its immediate “spatial vicinity”. To prove our assertion, we take e to be the
fourth co¨ordinate axis; then the ﬁrst three components of e are equal to zero
and g44 > 0. We can set

2 − Q(x1x2x3).

Since ds2 has the index of inertia 3, the quadratic form Q must be positive
deﬁnite. All those elements and only those for which x4 = 0 holds are
orthogonal to e. This proves our assertion. We see, furthermore, that every
line element can be split up uniquely into two summands, one of which
is parallel to e (has components proportional to those of e) and the other
orthogonal to e. We call the direction of the second summand the “spatial
direction” of the line element. Such spatial directions orthogonal to e form
angles with one another that can be calculated in the usual manner with
the help of the quadratic form −ds2, which is positive for such directions.
Using this prescription, we identify (in the natural way) the angle between

10

123

790

H. Weyl

the spatial directions of light signals emitted from two stars and meeting at
P , with the diﬀerence in the angles of the two directions in which the point
eye sights the two stars at the given moment. We consider this diﬀerence
in direction to be, at least approximately, something directly ascertainable;
indeed, in seeing, the qualitative can also have the feature of being “spatially
extended” (an aspect that cannot be traced back to the qualitative content
of perception). By making use of appropriate instruments for observation,
the observations of angles can be made more exact; however the task remains
for the consciousness of determining if two directions are distinguishable or
indistinguishable (co¨ıncidence of cross-hairs and position of the star, reading
oﬀ from a graduated circle). – At any rate, this simple scheme suﬃces in
principle for the description of how the observation of stars can be used to
test E i n s t e i n’s theory.

In connexion with what preceded, I want to show in the simplest way
how one can derive F e r m a t’s principle of fastest arrivals for a static grav-
itational ﬁeld from the general principle “the world line of a light signal is
a singular geodesic line”.
If we choose to describe a geodesic line by the
parameter s in accordance with equation (4), then it is characterized by the
variational principle

valid for a virtual displacement for which the ends of the segment of the
world line being considered remain ﬁxed. (Alternatively, one can start from

We can apply the same method to ascertain a minimal principle for the
trajectory of a point mass in a static gravitational ﬁeld. Let us assume that
the point mass m moreover has an electric charge e and is subjected to an

B. Theory of the Static, Rotationally Symmetric Gravitational

Field

§ 4. Point mass without and with electric charge

For what follows,
it will be necessary to make a few comments about
S c h w a r z s c h i l d’s determination of the gravitational ﬁeld of a point mass
at rest12. Upon introduction of appropriate co¨ordinates, a three-dimensional,
spherically symmetric line element necessarily has the form

dσ2 = μ(dx1

where μ and l depend only on the distance

(cid:7)

r =

x1

2 + x2

2 + x3

2.

The length scale for measuring this distance can be chosen so as to render
μ = 1; we make this choice. For the four-dimensional line element, we have
to choose the form

ds2 = f dx4

2 − dσ2,

where f is also only a function of r. If we now set

1 + lr2 = h

and the square root of the determinant hf equal to w, then a short calcula-
tion, which for convenience we perform for the point x1 = r, x2 = 0, x3 = 0,
yields the value

a is related to the mass m via the equation a = κm; we call a gravitational
radius of the mass m.

In order to illustrate the geometry characterized by the line element dσ2,
we conﬁne ourselves to the plane x3 = 0 passing through the origin. If we
introduce polar co¨ordinates in it

x1 = r cos ϑ,

x2 = r sin ϑ,

then we get

dσ2 = h dr2 + r2 dϑ2.

This line element characterizes the geometry that is valid on the paraboloid
of rotation

(cid:7)

z =

8a(r − 2a)

in a Euclidean space with the orthogonal co¨ordinates x1, x2, z if the paraboloid
is projected orthogonally onto the z = 0 plane with the polar co¨ordinates
r, ϑ. The projection covers the exterior of the circle r ≥ 2a twice, but does
not cover the interior at all. Via natural analytic continuation, the true space
will cover the domain r ≥ 2a doubly in the co¨ordinate space of the xi used to
represent it. The two coverings are separated by the sphere r = 2a on which
the mass lies and at which the metric becomes singular and one has to refer
to the two halves as the “outside” and “inside” of the point mass.

This may become clearer upon introducing another co¨ordinate system
into which I need to transform S c h w a r z s c h i l d’s equations at any rate in
order to proceed further. The transformation equations read

Having derived the ﬁeld of an electrically charged point mass, it is easy to
use the last paragraph of § 3 to calculate the motion of a test body subject to
this ﬁeld, where its mass and charge are weak relative to those generating the
ﬁeld; as in the charge-free case (planetary motion13), this problem is solved
exactly using elliptic functions .
§ 5. The ﬁeld of a rotationally symmetric distribution of masses
The acquisition of exact solutions to the equations of gravity seems important
to me with regard to the question of processes at work within the atom. After
all, it is possible that at such scales it is essential to take the non-linearity
of the exact laws of nature into account.
It has long been well-known to
mathematicians that in comparison to linear equations, the properties of
non-linear diﬀerential equations, in particular regarding their singularities,
are extremely complicated, unexpected and, at present, completely uncon-
trollable. It is well-known to physicists that peculiar processes must be at
work inside the atom that have no analogue in the visible world, where the
sum of forces is determined by the principle of superposition. I believe that
these two things could be closely related and, indeed, that we could expect
the deﬁnitive interpretation of quantum theory to stem from this relation-
ship. To this end, granted, one that still lies in the distant future, it seems
to me of interest to determine exactly the gravitational ﬁeld of an axially
symmetric distribution of masses and charges according to E i n s t e i n’s the-
ory. This will be done here for the static case; the study leads to surprisingly
simple results.

The co¨ordinates that play a rˆole are: 1. the time x4 = t; 2. a spatial
co¨ordinate singled out from the others, the angle x3 = ϑ about the axis of
rotation with the period 2π; ϑ = constant is a meridional half-plane ending
at the axis of rotation. To label the points in this half-plane, we have 3.
two co¨ordinates x1, x2 that we are now going to normalize. The line element

It is very instructive to trace how the point mass ﬁts in to the general
theory of rotationally symmetric mass distributions that has just been de-
rived. We begin by taking the form (12) and introduce cylindrical co¨ordinates
instead of the “orthogonal” co¨ordinates xi:

x1 = r cos ϑ,

x2 = r sin ϑ,

x3 = z;

r2 + z2. We then
the r appearing in (12) must of course be replaced by
carry out the following conformal transformation in the meridional half-plane

hf is indeed that solution to equation (16) in the entire plane r

in canonical co¨ordinates, the “point mass” thus appears not as a sphere, but
as a line segment, the meridional half-plane as the entire plane with a cut
along the two solid half-lines, and the axis of rotation as the cut (connected
at inﬁnity), which must be traversed as indicated in the ﬁgure by the arrows
and numbers. The right half of the entire plane corresponds to the outside,
the left half to the inside of the point mass. Our interpretation as asserted in
§ 4. is conﬁrmed anew: if we were not to take into account the “inside”, then
√
we would not arrive at the correct solution. One can convince oneself that
with
lg
a cut that vanishes along the edges of the cut. —One would have been led
naturally to this exact solution of the equations of gravity by studying the
ﬁeld of a line segment of length 2κm covered by the mass m. Having found
the ﬁeld, then measuring out the “line segment” with the invariant spatial
line element dσ2 would then have shown however, that in reality it is not a
line segment at all, but rather the surface of a sphere: in the exact theory
of gravity, one can only determine a posteriori to which mass distribution a
solution that one arrived at by some ansatz corresponds.
§ 6. The ﬁeld of a rotationally symmetric distribution of charges
If the masses at rest carry static electric charges, then, in addition to the
gravitational ﬁeld, an electrostatic ﬁeld arises that can be derived from the
potential Φ = Φ(x1, x2). As in the beginning of § 5., x1 and x2 are isothermic

If we take into account not only the ﬁeld-action, but also the substance-action
as in § 1., then, to begin with, the general action principle yields through
variation of Φ:

Δf Φ = −ε

∗

= −hε

(ε = absolute charge density).

In order to determine the gravitational ﬁeld, by setting δΦ = 0 as of now,
we obtain the equation

δH∗

= δM + δL∗

.

It tells us again that Δ2 r = 0; thus the introduction of the canonical
co¨ordinates is possible and we again set x1 = z, x2 = r. Eq. (17) now
reads:

The arbitrary additive constant that appears in Φ will be chosen, as usual,
so that Φ vanishes at inﬁnity.

Equating the coeﬃcients of δλ in (18) results in Eq. (13) of the last section,
with the modiﬁcation that on the right hand side, in addition to the mass
term (cid:11)
, the additional term 1/f [ΦΦ] arising from the likewise gravitating
electric energy appears; thus:

If the mass and charge are located only on an elementary ring with radius

of standard electrostatics for the quantity

If one makes use of this to determine the above integral as a function of
location in the meridional half-plane and from that Φ and f — we shall
carry out the calculation in a moment — then one can see that m is the

The problem can be solved more explicitly if we assume that mass and
charge are distributed arbitrarily, but in the same fashion, i.e. that the ratio
is a constant independent of position. We denote the Euclidean
σ
in the space of canonical co¨ordinates, i.e. the total
volume integral over σ
, the total charge, by e. The
mass, by m and the analogous integral of ε
aforementioned constant ratio will then be m : e. (22) is still the standard

Calculating integral (22), we arrive at the following result:

If the charge distribution (which is proportional to the mass distribution by
assumption) is known in the canonical co¨ordinate system and its “elemen-
tary” potential, i.e. the potential found according to the elementary theory
without taking gravity into account, when multiplied by the constant factor

ring. For large R this means that

which implies that m is indeed the gravitational mass, as claimed above.

With the current assumptions, we still need to calculate the second co-
eﬃcient h from the canonical line element. To that end, we have Eq. (14),
§ 5. at our disposal. If we treat it in the same way we did there, then for

If we then switch to the C.G.S. system — the factor 1
2 on the right hand side
is then to be replaced by κ/c2 — and use expressions (23), then the equation
for γ takes on the simple form

(24)

Δ2 γ = [ϕ, ϕ].

If we do not assume the proportionality of charge and mass, then the
solution cannot be obtained by such simple means. Now the numbers for
(cid:2)
the electron and the atomic nucleus are such that a/a
is very small, of the
−17 respectively. Given this situation, the eﬀect of gravity
order 10
can be neglected entirely with respect to that of charge. If we specialize our
equations accordingly, i.e. by choosing a = 0, ϕ0 = 0 then we arrive at the
statement:

−20 and 10

If the (axially symmetric) distribution of charge at rest, the eﬀect of which
is so strong as to render the eﬀect of gravity negligible in comparison, is
known in the canonical co¨ordinate system and its elementary potential mul-
tiplied by

The appearance of trigonometric functions, which are so closely related
to integers through their periodicity, is rather surprising; the principle of
superposition no longer holds in realms in which the value of ϕ is close to
1. In fact, the potentials of the eﬀective forces are trigonometric functions

of quantities that obey this principle. For suﬃciently concentrated charge, it
may happen that this charge is enclosed in surface S upon which ϕ reaches
f become inﬁnite. Since according to (24),
the value π/2 and hence Φ and
hf remains ﬁnite on this “border to the outer world”, the spatial line element
becomes dσ2 = 0; thus S turns out to be without extent as measured by the
invariant line element. — Our result can hardly be used to understand the
processes in the atom; after all, discrepancies between the ﬁeld of the electron
charge e and the ﬁeld as determined by the classical theory without gravity,
are only noticeable for distances of the order a ∼ 10

−33cm!

In the canonical co¨ordinate system, the spherically symmetric point mass
on which the electricity is distributed

appears as a circular disc of radius a
as it is for a charged metal plate in standard electrostatics.
