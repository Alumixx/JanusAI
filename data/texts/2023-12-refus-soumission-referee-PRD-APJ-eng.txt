Title:

Astrophysical Journal 

Janus, the only cosmological model that explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion,  

  
Dear Dr. D'Agostini:  
 
I am writing to you with regard to your manuscript cited above, which you recently submitted 
to The Astrophysical Journal. I regret to tell you that we are not able to undertake further 
consideration of your submission for publication in the AAS Journals.  
 
This is not a viable cosmological model, regardless of whether or not it fits the supernovae 
data. A satisfactory model has to be consistent with the results of cosmological 
nucleosynthesis, the power spectrum of anisotropies of the microwave background and the 
congruence of peaks in that power spectrum and bumps in the galaxy correlation function.  
 
I have also have a couple of minor criticisms which you may wish to consider. First, :"dark

energy" is a positive energy density. Its role in cosmic acceleration comes from its large 
negative pressure. This is consistent with a positive potential energy of unknown origin 
(although it is also consistent with simply regarding it as a cosmological constant). I don't 
think anyone is under the illusion that we understand it and consequently the second 
paragraph in your paper comes across as patronizing.  
 
Regards, 
xxx  AAS Editor-in-Chief

Cher	Dr.	D'Agostini	:		
Je	vous	écris	au	sujet	de	votre	manuscrit	cité	ci-dessus,	que	vous	avez	récemment	
soumis	à	The	Astrophysical	Journal.	J'ai	le	regret	de	vous	annoncer	que	nous	ne	sommes	
pas	en	mesure	de	poursuivre	l'examen	de	votre	soumission	en	vue	de	sa	publication	
dans	les	revues	de	l'AAS.		
Ce	n'est	pas	un	modèle	cosmologique	viable,	qu'il	corresponde	ou	non	aux	données	des	
supernovae.	Un	modèle	satisfaisant	doit	être	cohérent	avec	les	résultats	de	la	
nucléosynthèse	cosmologique,	le	spectre	de	puissance	des	anisotropies	du	fond	diffus	et	
la	congruence	des	pics	de	ce	spectre	de	puissance	et	des	bosses	de	la	fonction	de	
corrélation	des	galaxies.		
J'ai	également	quelques	critiques	mineures	que	vous	voudrez	peut-être	prendre	en	
considération.	Premièrement,	"	l'énergie	sombre	"	est	une	densité	d'énergie	positive.	
Son	rôle	dans	l'accélération	cosmique	provient	de	sa	grande	pression	négative.	Cela	est	
cohérent	avec	une	énergie	potentielle	positive	d'origine	inconnue	(bien	que	cela	soit	
également	cohérent	avec	le	fait	de	la	considérer	simplement	comme	une	constante	
cosmologique).	Je	ne	pense	pas	que	quiconque	ait	l'illusion	de	comprendre	ce	
phénomène	et,	par	conséquent,	le	deuxième	paragraphe	de	votre	article	apparaît	comme	
condescendant.

Abstract	: We	show	that	it	is	possible	to	integrate	negative	masses	into	the	Janus	
cosmological	model	by	describing	the	universe	as	a	manifold	equipped	with	two	metrics,	
one	referring	to	positive	masses	and	the	other	to	negative	masses,	as	solutions	of	a	
system	of	two	coupled	field	equations.	The	acceleration	of	the	cosmic	expansion	then	
results	from	the	dominance	of	the	negative	energy	content,	showing	a	good	agreement	
with	observational	data.	
______________________________________________________________________________________________	
				1	-		Introduction	:	
				At	the	end	of	the	2000s,	observation	data	began	to	accumulate,	tending	to	show	the	
movement	of	expansion,	far	from	slowing	down	as	previously	expected,	was	on	the	
contrary	accelerating.	The	collected	data	were	considered	sufficiently	reliable	for	this	
discovery	to	be	rewarded	with	a	Nobel	Prize	in	2011	([1],[2],[3]).	However	the	cause	of	
this	acceleration	remained	unknown.	The	only	approach	proposed	by	specialists	
consisted	in	reintroducing	the	cosmological	constant	in	the	equation	serving	as	the	basis	
for	general	relativity,	the	famous	Einstein's	equation:	
	(1)																																																	
R gµν + Λgµν = χTµν	
				In	the	past,	before	the	Italian	Torricelli	discovered	atmospheric	pressure,	it	was	
considered	that	the	cause	of	mercury	rising	in	the	barometers	was	"the	horror	of	the	
vacuum",	which	we	applied	to	quantify.	But	it	did	not	constitute	a	real	explanation,	
relying	on	clear	physical	foundations.	Later	on,	it	was	evidently	established	that	what	
caused	the	column	of	mercury	to	rise	in	the	tube	was	nothing	but	than	the	impact	of	the		
very	numerous	collisions	of	air	molecules	on	the	free	surface	of	the	liquid	metal,	
resulting	which	was	called	pressure.	In	the	same	way,	that	“the	introduction	of	this	
cosmological	constant	in	the	equation,	translates	a	repulsive	power	of	the	vacuum"	
cannot	be	considered	as	a	satisfactory	explanation.	
			The	scientific	community	then	gave	it	the	qualifier	“dark	energy”,	which	then	has	a	
negative	value.	On	the	dynamic	level,	this	new	unknown	component	is	of	considerable,	
majority	importance.	The	specialists	are	since	looking	for		a	component	of	the	cosmic	
soup	which	makes	it	possible	to	clarify	this	problem.

 						Many	attempts	to	describe	dark	energy	have	been	proposed.	But	none	achieves	the	
bare	minimum	of	credibility	worth	mentioning.	We	present	an	explanation	which	
introduces	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	model.	This	has	been	attempted	for	a	
long	time	by	the	cosmologist	Hermann	Bondi	[4].	This	one	concludes	that	the	laws	
governing	the	interactions	between	positive	and	negative	masses,	within	the	framework	
of	general	relativity,	do	not	lead	to	a	true	model,	valid	on	the	physical	plan.	They	
especially	violate	the	fundamental	principles	of	action-reaction	and	equivalence.	Let's	
come	back	to	this	point.	We	recall	that	general	relativity,	considered	as	a	major	and	
decisive	advance	in	our	understanding	of	the	cosmos	since	1917,	is	based	on	the	
following	points:	
-	The	universe,	the	space-time,	is	a	M4	manifold,	a	four-dimensional	hypersurface,	
defined	at	any	point	and	at	any	time	by	its	metric	field	 
-	From	this	metric	we	can	calculate	two	sets	of	geodesics.	Those	of	non-zero	length	are	
followed	by	particles	of	matter,	those	of	zero	length	by	photons.	
 -	If	we	know	the	source	of	the	field,	so	the	values	at	any	point	of	the	components	of	the	
Tµν,	we	can	calculate	the	metric	solution	 
tensor	of	the	second	member	 
gµν	.	
-	If	we	concentrate	on	the	of	non-zero	length	geodesics,	the	ones	referring	to	the	masses,	
Tµν,	there	is	only	one	family	of	geodesics,	along	which	the	control	
for	a	given	field	 
particles	will	circulate,	whether	their	masses	are	positive	or	negative.	
					To	tackle	this	problem	with	precision,	we	resort	to	the	two	metric	solutions	
constructed	by	Schwarzschild	in	1916	([5],[6]).	There	is	first	the	interior	metric	solution	
describing	a	mass	M,	likened	to	a	sphere	filled	with	an	incompressible	fluid	of	constant	
density ρo .

					As	a	conclusion:		
					-	Negative	masses	repel	their	fellow	beings	as	well	as	positive	masses	
	
					Thus,	if	two	masses	of	opposite	signs	are	brought	together,	the	positive	mass	flees,	
pursued	by	the	negative	mass.	Both	undergo	a	uniform	acceleration	without	any	input	of	
energy,	since	that	of	the	negative	mass	is	negative.	We	have	given	the	name	runaway	to	
this	phenomenon,	which	violates	both	the	principle	of	action-reaction	and	the	principle	
of	equivalence	(	Fig.3).

						This	was	envisaged	as	early	as	1995	([7],[8]),	with	some	profit,	with	respect	to	an	
attempt	to	explain	the	large-scale	structure	of	the	universe	and	the	spiral	structure	of	
galaxies	[8]	.	But	we	then	ran	into	a	serious	pitfall:	these	laws	were	in	opposition	to	what

masses,	positive	and	negative,	behave	differently	when	they	were	immersed	in	the	same	
gravitational	field.	To	do	this	they	had	to	follow	different	geodesic	curves,	from	two

general	relativity.	The	interaction	relies	entirely	on	the	“interaction	tensors”	 
Over	the	course	of	an	article	reaching	forty	pages,	the	two	authors	try	different	
approaches,	based	on	different	models,	without	achieving	the	slightest	result.	Moreover	
the	model	is	complicated	by	the	assumption	that	the	interactions	involve	gravitons	with	
a	mass	spectrum.					
									The	German	Sabine	Hossenfelder	produces	the	second	attempt	in	2008	[11]:			
	
(9)																																								
							The	two	interacting	geometric	entities	are	then	identified	by	the	Greek	letters	κ et 
ν 	.	The	construction	of	the	interaction	terms	is	then	based	on	the	introduction	of	a	
functional,	covariant	relation:	
	(10)																																																
						The	author	therefore	limits	himself	to	a	systematic	and	binding	hypothesis	of	
symmetry	between	the	two	entities.	This	leads	him	to	build	an	evolution	scheme	based	
on	two	FRLW	metrics,	simple	copies	of	each	other.	The	interaction	laws	are	deduced	
from	the	two	equations,	through	the	Newtonian	approximation.	Under	these	conditions,	
the	scheme	once	again	leads	to	a	violation	of	the	principle	of	equivalence,	and	the	author	
concludes	that	this	is	a	property	of	all	bimetric	systems.	
	
				This	is	incorrect.	The	Janus	system	of	equations	(12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19])	
can	at	this	stage	be	considered	as	a	variant	of	the	model	d	'Hossenfelder,	at	the	cost	of	a	
simple	sign	change	(modulo	the	mode	of	writing	the	interaction	tensors):

under	the	control	of	the	majority	negative	mass	population.	This	asymmetry	will	be	
explained	in	a	future	article.							
					The	exploitation	of	this	asymmetry	hypothesis	had	been	exploited	in	[7]	through	
numerical	simulations.	Under	these	conditions	the	negative	masses,	whose	accretion	
time	is	then	lower:

Thus	the	negative	masses	form	a	regular	system	of	spheroidal	clusters,	confining	the	
positive	mass	in	the	remnant	place,	giving	it	a	lacunar	structure.	This	will	be	taken	up	
and	developped	in	a	future	article.		
	
						Before	bringing	this	asymmetry	hypothesis	into	play,	let's	start	by	examining	the	
compatibility	of	equations	(12)	when	we	assign	them	solutions,	homogeneous	and	
isotropic,	of	the	FRLW	type:

					These	equations	become:

with	the	conservation	of	energy:

					A	similar	treatment	(compatibility	between	the	two	equations)	leads	to	the	condition:

5	–	Conclusion.		
						The	model	presented	represents	a	profound	change	in	the	cosmological	paradigm	in	
the	sense	that	we	move	from	a	description	of	the	universe	as	a	variety	equipped	with	a	
single	metric	 
gµν,	solution	of	a	single	field	equation,	Einstein's	equation,	to	a	manifold	
equipped	with	two	metrics	 
(−)	,	referring	respectively	to	positive	masses	and	
negative	masses,	solutions	of	a	system	of	two	coupled	field	equations.	The	Newtonian	
approximation	then	provides	interaction	laws	which,	unlike	what	emerges	from	the	
introduce	 negative	 masses	
attempt	 to	
into	 the	 Einsteinian	 model	 (runaway	
phenomenon),	satisfy	the	principles	of	action-reaction	and	equivalence.	Masses	of	the	
same	sign	then	attract	each	other	according	to	Newton's	law,	while	masses	of	opposite	
signs	repel	each	other	according	to	"anti-Newton".	As	will	be	developed	in	the	following	
articles,	gravitational	instability	tends	to	separate	these	two	populations.	Under	these	
conditions,	when	one	population	dominates	in	one	region	of	the	universe,	the	other	is	
mainly	excluded.	
						Then	the	first	equation	of	the	proposed	system	is	identified	with	Einstein's	equation,	
which	then	appears	as	a	limiting	description,	in	the	regions	where	the	negative	mass	
content	can	be	neglected.	The	model	thus	agrees	with	the	classic	verifications	of	general	
relativity,	of	a	local	nature.	As	will	be	shown	in	subsequent	articles,	these	negative	mass	
particles	are	simply	negative	mass	anti-hydrogen	and	anti-helium.	We	will	show	that	the	
result	of	the	interaction	with	the	positive	masses	and	the	photons	of	positive	energy	
accounts	for	all	the	phenomena	that	we	attributed	until	now	to	the	dark	matter,	which	is	
then	no	longer	necessary.	The	energy	of	this	negative	mass	population	being	itself	
negative	then	identifies	with	what	was	called	"dark	energy".	Thus	the	two	components	
of	the	model	are	thus	replaced	by	a	single	component,	ensuring	these	two	functions,	
perfectly	identified.	As	negative	mass	particles	emit	negative	energy	photons,	they	
escape	our	observations	in	the	field	of	optics.	Incidentally,	and	this	will	also	be	the	
subject	of	another	article,	this	negative	mass	antimatter	is	then	identified	with	this	great	
absentee:	primordial	antimatter,	another	problem	for	which	the	Janus	cosmological	
model	is	the	only	one	to	provide	a	precise	and	consistent	answer.	
					That	said,	we	show	that	this	new	Janus	cosmological	model	perfectly	accounts	for	the	
acceleration	of	cosmic	expansion,	being	the	only	one	to	provide	a	real	explanation	of	this	
phenomenon.

					It	is	therefore	necessary,	in	order	to	ensure	the	mathematical	and	physical	coherence	
of	this	system,	that	the	interaction	terms	also	satisfy	these	relations.	Remember	that	
Einstein's	equation,	the	backbone	of	general	relativity,	provides	only	two	types	of	
solutions:		
	
-  Uniform	and	isotropic	time	dependent,	solutions	:	Friedman	models.		
	
-  Time	independent	solutions	referring	either	to	empty	regions	or	to	masses	
assimilated	to	volumes	filled	with	an	incompressible	fluid	of	constant	density.	
 					The	Bianchi	conditions	identify,	in	the	first	case,	to	the	conservation	of	energy	and	
mass.	In	the	second	case,	we	see	emerging,	within	the	masses,	the	relationship	reflecting	
the	balance	between	the	force	of	gravity	and	the	force	of	pressure.	So	this	is	analyzed	by	
considering	the	inner	Schwarzschild	metric.	The	problem	had	thus	been	completely	
dealt	with	by	Karl	Schwarzschild	in	his	second	article	of	1916	[6]	where	he	even	went	so	
far	as	to	explain	the	law	p(r).	This	analysis	was	subsequently	taken	up	by	Tolman	[22],	
Oppenheimer	and	Volkoff	[23]	and	specialists	then	know	this	relationship	in	its	
differential	form,	as	the	so	called	“Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff	equation	of	state”	or	
“TOV	equation”.	For	example,	all	the	details	of	such	a	calculation	can	be	found	in	
reference	[24],	in	chapter	14.	
						If	we	now	shift	to	the	system	of	the	two	coupled	field	equations,	when	we	consider	
the	unsteady	solutions,	describing	homogeneous	and	isotropic	media	and	we	are	
satisfied	with	the	"dust	phases",	where	the	pressures	 p(+)and	 p(−)can	be	neglected,	a	
very	simple	case,	in	all	respects	analogous	to	what	is	done	with	a	single	species,	in	
general	relativity,	leads	to	the	following	compatibility	relation,	reflecting	a	generalized	
conservation	of	energy:

M(r)  being	the	mass	contained	in	a	sphere	of	radius	r.	This	relationship	
expresses	the	balance	between	the	force	of	pressure	and	the	force	of	gravity.	
			Passing	to	equation	(7)	and	placing	ourselves	again	in	the	Newtonian	approximation,	
for	there	to	be	compatibility	between	the	two	field	equations	we	must	find	the	same
