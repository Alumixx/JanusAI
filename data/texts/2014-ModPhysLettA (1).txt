An extension of a previously published model of a bimetric Universe is presented, where
the speeds of light associated to positive and negative mass species are diﬀerent. As
shown earlier, the asymmetry of the model explains the acceleration of the positive
species, while the negative one slows down. Asymmetry aﬀects scale factors linked to
lengths, times and speeds of light; so that if a mass inversion of a craft can be achieved,
then interstellar travels would become non-impossible at a velocity less than the speed
of light of the negative sector, and possibly much higher than that of the positive sector.

Keywords: Janus cosmological model; dark energy; bimetric model; negative mass;

1. Introduction

Only a few decades ago there were many scientists who doubted that intelligent
life could exist in the Universe elsewhere than on Earth. Some of them doubted
about the possibility of life being present in other planets on the sole grounds of
probabilities. This position can be summed up by the famous Drake formula which
is expressed as a product of multiple probabilities. And skeptics say: “Suppose that
one of those factors is zero, and then the probability would fall to nothing”. Even
further, there were scientists who wondered if a planetary system around a star
could ever be a common thing in the Universe.

Observations in the last decade have completely upset this view. But in fact
we are witnessing a rearguard action aimed at challenging the existence of planets
with intelligent life with the same level of organization than that found on Earth.

When the ﬁrst exoplanet was discovered in 1995 by Mayor and Queloz, 40 light-
years away from Earth, it was evidently a giant planet unsuitable for hosting life.
Skeptics asked whether planetary systems with telluric planets could ever exist.
They thought that even if telluric planets were to exist in extrasolar systems, it
was unlikely they might bear surface conditions conducive to the emergence of
life. In the line of arguments against this eventuality was the requirement of the
existence of a satellite around the planet, allowing the latter to stabilize its rotation
movement. In fact, proponents of the theory of deterministic chaos had shown, using
computer simulations, that the axis of rotation of a lonely planet would be unstable
and topple completely, making the emergence of life very problematic. But these
simulations do consider the Earth as a rigid sphere, which she is far from being at
the scale of the phenomena considered.

Returning to the so now called exoplanets, their number has rapidly grown, and
it will still grow with increasing acceleration, as it happens for any existing object
in the cosmos, as a function of the progress of detection systems. Telluric planets,
including those lying “within the band of water”, were soon discovered next to the
stars they orbit.

All the prejudices on which one could rely to defy the existence of life on a planet
collapsed one after another. And it became not as evident as before the fact that
not only Sun-like stars may be conducive to the emergence of life in its associated
planetary system.

Nowadays the view of a scientist like Drake has been totally reversed, and it
is likely that his formula will soon be forgotten. According to Ref. 41, the NASA,
based on the fact that 1500 planets were detected within a radius of 50 light-years
from the Earth, used this ﬁgure to estimate 100 billions of the minimum number
of planets in the Milky Way. This number should be weighted by a coeﬃcient of
habitability on which we should still come to an agreement. But that makes us to
think that the probability of the Earth not being the only inhabited planet in our
galaxy cannot be zero. An estimation of this number being made, if it is multiplied
by the number of galaxies in the observable Universe, a considerable ﬁgure is anyway
obtained.

One can sum this up in one sentence: “The probability that there does not exist,
not only in the Universe but in our own galaxy, a planet other than ours, which
is carrier of organized and intelligent life, must be considered as zero”. So it was
compelling to recognize that the belief of the skeptics was nothing more than the
manifestation of a ridiculous geocentrism.

You can still ﬁnd however scientists that doubt that the level of organization of
life, such as it exists on Earth, can be found elsewhere in other planets. Some of
them say: “Life elsewhere, yes, but only in bacterial form”.

Humans are indeed facing an unprecedented awareness in Earth’s history, with
the obvious impacts on all their religious beliefs. Some precursors, such as Andrei
Sakharov, have expressed a very advanced view on this, which is summarized in
the last lines of his acceptance speech of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. Given

Janus cosmological model with two speeds of light

the stature of this scientist and the outstanding quality of his contributions in
various scientiﬁc ﬁelds, ranging from hot plasma physics (he was the designer of
the ﬁrst Soviet hydrogen bomb) to magnetohydrodynamics (where he was, during
the ’50s, one of the pioneers) and cosmology, it seemed important to us to quote his
own words:

Thousands of years ago tribes of human beings suﬀered great privations in
the struggle to survive. In this struggle, it was important not only to be able
to handle a club, but also to possess the ability to think reasonably, to take
care of the knowledge and experience garnered by the tribe, and to develop
the links that would provide cooperation with other tribes. Today the entire
human race is faced with a similar test. In inﬁnite space many civilizations
are bound to exist, among them civilizations that are also wiser and more
“successful ” than ours. I support the cosmological hypothesis which states
that the development of the Universe is repeated in its basic features an inﬁ-
nite number of times. In accordance with this, other civilizations, including
more “successful ” ones, should exist an inﬁnite number of times on the
“preceding” and the “following” pages of the Book of the Universe. Yet this
should not minimize our sacred endeavors in this world of ours, where, like
faint glimmers of light in the dark, we have emerged for a moment from the
nothingness of dark unconsciousness of material existence. We must make
good the demands of reason and create a life worthy of ourselves and of the
goals we only dimly perceive.

In this text is explicitly mentioned the fact that earthlings might not be the
most advanced intelligent species in terms of science and technology. It is the log-
ical view every reasonable scientist should assume. But it leads immediately to
one question: More advanced civilizations that our own, have they been able to
visit us, including ancient times of our history? If such visits were technically and
scientiﬁcally possible, do they currently continue?

Faced with this question, skeptics exhibits two arguments. First, as once did
Enrico Fermi, they are amazed that there has not been any contact at all. Second,
they evoke the impossibility of interstellar travel due to the severe limitation im-
posed on the speed of a craft by the laws, repeatedly checked at all scales, of special
relativity.

On the ﬁrst argument, let us say that any contact between civilizations with very
diﬀerent technical and scientiﬁc levels of development is unavoidably accompanied
by a shock of cultures. Diﬀerent scenarios are then possible. In one of them, the
low-level scientiﬁc and technological civilization quite simply collapses. In a second
one the most advanced civilization does swallows up the one which it comes in
contact with. It can assimilate it, or enslave it (colonization). In a third scenario, a
powerful scientiﬁc and technological transfer occurs, which is immediately converted
with priority, as in any fundamental progress of technology, into new weapons.

Any progress in science is inevitably accompanied by a subsequent progress in
destructive capacity. So that if some advanced sophisticated technoscience arose
which made interstellar travel possible, the corollary would be the emergence of
huge means of destruction. In comparison, such new weapons would make our
thermonuclear warheads look like match sticks.

I do not think I would be contradicted by saying that wisdom is far from Earth
where, despite past dramas, we wonder if humanity would not soon switch into a
third world war. Thus, any technology transfer would not do other but accentuate
the deadly imbalance which we suﬀer and that is not going to get better with time.
This paper focuses on the second argument, the feasibility of interstellar travel.

2. A Bimetric Model

The cosmological model of General Relativity represents an extension of the revo-
lution represented by the appearance of Special Relativity. It is worth to think for
a moment about the essence of these profound changes of paradigm. The transition
from Newtonian physics to relativistic physics is based on a modiﬁcation of the
geometric paradigm. Special Relativity can be summed up in the sentence: “We
live in a spacetime which is an M4 manifold with a hyperbolic Lorentz metric of
signature (+ − −−)”. General Relativity can be stated accordingly: “The Universe
is an M4 manifold with a Riemannian metric of signature (+ − −−)” which is a
solution of the Einstein equation:
Rμν − 1
2

Rgμν + Λgμν = χTμν .

(1)

Every travel in this context can proceed only by moving along the geodesics asso-
ciated with the metric gμν that is solution of the equation. These geodesics include
two subsets: those of nonzero length followed by particles that own a mass, and
those of zero length, followed by photons. This statement implies an unavoidable
limit for all velocities, that is the speed of light c. In the domain of relativistic
velocities, an enormous energy must be involved, and the limitation to a speed c
implies the fact that, according to this vision of the Universe, an almost inﬁnite
energy is necessary to reach it.

Everything else follows and all those who have tried to model the interstellar
travel are led to travel times that are incompatible with the duration of human life.
The conclusion is therefore the following: if interstellar travel is scientiﬁcally and
technically feasible, that is, compatible with the duration of human life, then a deep
change in the current cosmological paradigm, which prohibits such an eventuality
must be operated.

One could say that the current situation somehow calls for such a change of
paradigm. Theoretical astrophysics virtually stopped in the early ’70s when theo-
rists, disregarding the approach initiated by Chandrasekhar in 1941,1 abandoned
any attempt to build a self-consistent model of galaxies and their spiral structure,
whenever they possess one, in favor of numerical computer simulations on which

high hopes were deposited and which have strictly produced nothing in half a cen-
tury. The improvement of observational data on the velocity curves of rotation of gas
in galaxies, and the discovery of gravitational arcs, soon attributed to gravitational
lens eﬀects and incompatible with the amount of matter in galaxies and clusters
of galaxies from photometric observations, gave birth to a deus ex machina: the
dark matter. But all attempts to identify this new component, being it MACHOs
or astroparticles, have failed. And it comes that since ten years ago it is conﬁrmed,
against all odds, that the Universe, rather than decelerate as a result of the attrac-
tive forces of visible matter and dark matter, accelerates instead (see Refs. 2–10).
Faced with this new dilemma, astrophysicists have not done anything but to create
a new word: dark energy. And have done so without having the slightest idea of the
nature of this new component, which would represent 70% of the cosmic content.
Many attempts were made in order to explain the nature of such phenomenon.
Among them, let us cite Refs. 11 to 14.

In 1967, Sakharov proposed a twin description of the Universe with the aid
of two entities linked by a Big Bang singularity, and with antiparallel arrows of
time.15–17 If we exclude our own work, which was initiated in 197718,19 using the
tools of non-relativistic Newtonian cosmology, and ignore the existence of his own,
this approach had no continuators. In 1994,20 we clariﬁed the approach by oﬀering a
bimetric description of the Universe. Though it has nothing to do with the bimetric
models of Refs. 21 and 22 where the second metric refers to gravitons with nonzero
mass. Strictly speaking, these models have not produced anything.

μν and g

In our model, the Universe is an M4 manifold associated not to one single metric,
(−)
but to two: g
μν , the former linked to species of positive mass and energy,
the latter to species of negative mass and energy. From these metrics, one can build
(−)
the associated Ricci tensors, R
μν . A system of two coupled ﬁeld equations
was then proposed:20

where the tensors T
represent positive and negative energy contents
(and positive and negative mass contents as well). Previously, in 1957, Bondi23
did study the possibility of introducing negative masses into the Einsteinian model
with a single metric. As a result, positive masses attracted everything and negative
masses repelled everything. It then led to a phenomenon that was called “runaway”:
when a mass +m met a mass −m, the positive mass ﬂed, pursued by the negative
mass, both undergoing a continuous acceleration, with conservation of energy, since
one of the energies was positive and the other negative.

This idea of cohabitation of masses of opposed signs was therefore abandoned

during 57 years.

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) rejects the existence of negative energy states
on the basis that no state could exist with energy less than that of the vacuum.
This argument is developed by Weinberg in his book (Sec. 2.6 of Ref. 24). But it
is more a hypothesis than a demonstration in the sense that everything depends
on the choice of the T operator, that is, time inversion. If it is to be considered
as unitary and linear, then QFT enables the existence of negative energies, time
inversion being synonymous of energy inversion (which is the case in the Theory of
Dynamical Groups, build with real coeﬃcients25). In order to avoid this “disastrous”
situation, QFT imposes the choice of an anti-unitary and anti-linear T operator,
which does not invert energy.

The paper of 199420 was completed the following year with another publica-
tion26 and with a communication in an international workshop.27 This theoretical
description was also recently revisited.28 The main lines of this model are as follows:

– Particles of positive mass follow non-null geodesics of the g
(+)
– Photons of positive energy follow null geodesics of the g
μν metric.

– Particles of negative mass follow non-null geodesics of the g
(−)
– Photons of negative energy follow null geodesics of the g
μν metric.
– The two families of geodesics, one followed by particles of positive energy and

the other followed by particles of negative energy, are a priori disjoint.

– Particles of positive mass emit positive energy photons that can in turn be cap-

tured by observational devices constituted also by positive masses.

– Particles of negative mass emit negative energy photons that cannot be captured

by our observational devices.

References 26 and 27 contain results of 2D numerical simulations carried out in the
Daisy Laboratory in Germany with the computing capabilities of that time. They
give an idea of the fertility of such approach when it comes to explain the large-scale
structure of the Universe, galaxy conﬁnement and durable spiral structures. The
initial results could not be pursued because of the lack of access to adequate means
of calculation. Beyond that, the goal is obviously to build a complete cosmological
model, with a radiation dominated era and a matter dominated era. The schema in-
cludes therefore a radiative phase “with constant variables” and free of redshift. We
published the ﬁrst paper referring to a cosmological model with variable light speed
in this same journal in 1988,29,30 and then in 1995.26 Subsequently, we modiﬁed
the model28 on the assumption that the secular drift of the constants ceased when
the radiation was no longer the dominant component. Laws of evolution which are
not semi-empirical, but are derived from a universal gauge relationship assuring the
invariance of the equations of physics (ﬁeld equation, Maxwell equations, quantum
physics equations) were provided for the diﬀerent constants. If a is the scale factor
associated with length, the evolution of c is:26,29

Janus cosmological model with two speeds of light

It leads to a cosmological horizon that varies with a, which ensures cosmic homo-
geneity and makes the appeal to inﬂation theory unnecessary, what was already
stated in the conclusions of Ref. 30. Moreover, this evolution was “Lorentz invari-
ant”. But this is simply a remark. The formulation of the cosmic evolution in its
radiative phase and in the regime of “constant variables” will be the subject of a
future paper. It is at the end of this phase that the two cosmic sets, one of positive
energy, the other of negative energy, are provided with constant but very diﬀerent
c(+) and c(−) light speeds.

We mention here the work of Couannier,31 Hossenfelder32 and Milgrom33 which

also aim at the construction of a bimetric description of the Universe.

3. A Model with Two Diﬀerent Light Speeds

This section deals with a regime with two diﬀerent light speeds. Some previous
work was presented in Ref. 28. We take the system of two coupled ﬁeld equations:

photons along null geodesics of the metric g
on one hand, and the constants χ(+) and χ(−) on another hand, may be diﬀerent.
We assume this bimetric Universe is homogeneous and isotropic, so that the

Riemannian metric becomes:

Let us now develop the Newtonian approximation. The Universe owns a global
nonzero curvature. In steady-state or quasi steady-state condition, the Universe
can be considered as a large 3D hypersurface where very small regions contain
matter surrounded by large empty spaces where the metric corresponds to the
Lorentz solution of the Rμν = 0 equation. Consider a portion of empty space with
a ﬁnite extension. If we consider phenomena occurring over a characteristic time
that is small compared to the one corresponding to the evolution of the Universe,
the description by time-independent metric holds. Introduce a ﬁnite space extension
perturbation, corresponding to the terms γ

In quasi steady-state conditions, the two scale factors are considered as constants.

which are Poisson-like equations that represent an extension of Ref. 28 when the
two light speeds are diﬀerent. Using the two forms of geodesic equations we get for
the positive mass particles:

Building the dynamics from this set of equations would require a more reﬁned
solution, involving time scale factors T (+) and T (−). This will be developed in
a future paper. Anyway, it is possible to derive the laws in the simpliﬁed case
a(+) = a(−), c(+) = c(−). Then:

Referring to the previous works of Bondi23 and Bonnor,35 the puzzling problem of
runaway phenomenon is eliminated. This model ﬁts classical veriﬁcation associated
with General Relativity. As the two species repel each other, where positive mass is
present, negative mass is almost absent and the system of coupled ﬁeld equations
reduces to:

On the other hand, considering portions of space containing a sphere ﬁlled with
constant density matter (positive or negative) surrounded by vacuum, makes
“internal” and “external” Schwarzschild solutions features clearer, as ﬁrst presented
in Ref. 26 introducing a negative gravitational lensing eﬀect.

To give the relative size of the parameters involved, we need to develop the
non-steady solution applying to the radiative era with variable speeds of light. This
will also be done in a future paper.

The basic features of the bimetric model, interaction laws and negative lensing
eﬀect, were developed in Refs. 20, 26 and 27. In Ref. 28, from dynamical group
theory,25 the particles of the second sector are CPT-symmetrical with respect to
positive energy particles (protons, neutrons, electrons, photons and so on), which
gives them negative energy and mass. So the matter–antimatter duality holds in
the two sectors.

Given that masses of opposite signs repel each other, the component responsible
for the strong eﬀects of gravitational lensing around galaxies and clusters of galaxies

Janus cosmological model with two speeds of light

is in an ultra-rariﬁed state in the galaxies and also in the solar system (where it
could be responsible for the deceleration of the Pioneer space probes, a subject to
be examinated). If the proposed model is correct, then attempts to ﬁnd evidence
for the existence of astroparticles would be doomed to failure.

Reference 28 was focused on the explanation of the acceleration of the Universe,
caused by a negative pressure associated to the negative energy component. The
present paper has shown that a bimetric model can be associated with two diﬀerent
light speeds.

4. Back to the Problem of Interstellar Travel

The present work needs completion. A study of the radiation dominated era with
“variable constants” must be carried out in order to justify the diﬀerence between
c(+) and c(−). As evoked above, time scale factors should be added, which we have
not done in the present paper.

Species with positive and negative mass behave diﬀerently, the whole being fully
asymmetric. Sakharov15–17 was the ﬁrst to imagine an asymmetry in the character-
istic times of production of baryons from quarks, and of antibaryons from antiquarks
in our Universe. He suggested that the two twin Universes owned opposite arrows of
time (notice that according to dynamical group theory25 time inversion goes with
mass inversion). He suggested that diﬀerent rates of production of baryons and an-
tibaryons could explain the absence of cosmological antibaryons in our orthochron
Universe of positive masses and energies, while “primeval baryons” would be absent
in the twin Universe. This would go with a remnant of free antiquarks in our fold
and a remnant of quarks with negative energy in the twin.

The absence of primeval antimatter is therefore the ﬁrst smoking gun of such

asymmetry.

The second one is the Very Large Structure of the Universe, which according
to that model looks like joint soap bubbles (see Refs. 36–39). Negative mass would
form a set of clumps located at the center of each bubble.

As evoked in Ref. 28 a new cosmic cartography could be built on the basis of
a recent idea published by a Japanese group,40 which would make it possible to
size the ratio between averaged densities of the two species ρ(+) and ρ(−). Further
data could come from the analysis of magnitude of distant galaxies with strong
redshifts, considered classically as dwarfs. We believe they are “normal” galaxies
whose signal is weakened by negative gravitational lensing eﬀects. Notice that those
galaxies emit positive energy photons which can cross negative mass clumps.

As shown in former 2D simulations,26 macroscopic structures are diﬀerent in
positive and negative worlds. Negative mass forms spheroidal clumps, similar to
huge proto-stars whose cooling time is so great with respect to the age of the
Universe that fusion cannot occur. In the negative world there are no stars, no
galaxies, no heavy elements, no planets. Life is absent.
Scale factors are also diﬀerent: a(+) > a(−), so that in order to go from a

are diﬀerent depending on the mass of the object, positive or negative.

If mass inversion could be achieved, then the feasibility of interstellar travel should
be reconsidered. In eﬀect, a transferred vehicle would cruise along geodesics of the
metric g(−), with several gains:
– The speed limit (c(−) > c(+)) would be higher.
– Distances would be shorter: a(−) < a(+).
– The addition of a diﬀerent time gauge could reduce travel duration (to be devel-

oped in a future work).

Two questions remain:

– Is it possible to achieve mass inversion of a craft and its passengers?
– How to give to the craft a relativistic velocity with respect to the new value c(−)?

Mass inversion is accompanied by a local modiﬁcation of the geometry, which im-
plies a deconnection of the geodesics of one system and a reconnection with the
geodesics of the other system. We believe that such process occurs in nature and
will give a theoretical description of it in a future paper, showing subsequent ob-
servations. As we will show, if a mass is inverted, it does not imply that it goes
backwards in time and could emerge at a point of its own past. This is so because
the proper time is not modiﬁed by the process.

The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku suggests a classiﬁcation of civilizations of
“types I, II, III, etc.”. He imagines that the last of them would be capable of using
energies defying imagination, which would make interstellar travel possible. Would
it be necessary, for example, in order to ensure mass inversion of a given mass M ,
to use an energy comparable to M c2? Should we create a “wormhole” and jump in?
We believe that the energy we can handle today through nuclear technology and, in
the future, matter–antimatter annihilation, could be enough. We believe also that
our present science and technology has reached the required threshold if used in a
new geometric context.

If a given technology makes a craft’s mass inversion possible, it would seem to
dematerialize if observed by a witness. Negative mass particles, atoms and molecules
no longer interact with the positive molecules of the surrounding air except for
gravitation (in fact, anti-gravitation). We conjecture that the mass inversion process
would be symmetrical. If a positive mass is inverted in a given volume, this would

aﬀect the few negative masses present in the volume, whose mass would be inverted
too, and become positive. As a consequence, a highly rareﬁed medium would appear
in the volume, composed by few positive mass hydrogen atoms. For a positive mass
observer, the volume occupied by the craft would look empty. The air would ﬁll it
immediately, the process producing a hydrodynamical perturbation. If a plane is
ﬂying too close to a large craft that is inverting its own mass, the subsequent gas
perturbation could break it.

We will elaborate below, on a very conjectural basis, on a possible modiﬁcation
of the craft kinetic parameters after the hypothetic mass inversion process. Anyway,
an inverted mass would be repelled by the Earth, so that “it would fall upward”. An
appropriate cyclic mass inversion could cancel weight. In eﬀect, values of the craft
weight would be alternatively P = M g and P = −M g, that is zero on average.

A witness would say that the force of gravity is cancelled. Combination with ap-
propriate modiﬁcations of the kinetic parameters would ensure the crafts movement.

Particles with mass m own a characteristic length, the Compton’s length λc:

If mass inversion follows gauge laws as deﬁned in Ref. 26, then:

c ∼ 1√
a

,

h ∼ a

2 ,

m ∼ a .

It is an “apparent mass”, concept that will be developed in a future paper. This
leads to:

Mass inversion would be accompanied with some kind of “Gulliver eﬀect”.
Transferred in the new frame of reference, the inverted particles would have a Comp-
ton’s length greater than that of their sisters of negative mass because a(−) < a(+).
The subsequent energy is:

λc =

h
mc

.

λc ∼ a .

E =

.

(27)

Such transfer would occur with loss of energy. If we assume that mass transfer im-
plies energy conservation during the process of mass sign inversion, the transferred
particles must have Compton’s lengths equal to that of their “sisters” owing nega-
tive mass. This would be possible if, after mass inversion, particles gain relativistic
velocity so that their Compton’s length shortening is ensured by the Lorentz con-
traction. But the process should orient velocities in the same direction. If not, the
craft and the passengers would be splitted. Would the process be possible, inter-
stellar crafts would not need any propeller at all. The words “acceleration” and
“deceleration” would lose meaning. Thus, if a huge amount of energy is necessary
to accelerate a positive mass at a relativistic velocity, once its mass is inverted, a
comparable amount of energy is required to bring its speed to zero when the craft
cruises in the new negative frame of reference. After mass inversion, a craft would

go so fast that it could not slow down. But, arriving at its destination, a new mass
inversion would give it again its former kinetic parameters.

Even in a very primitive way, these travel techniques have nothing to do with
rocket propulsion. All relies on mass manipulation, together with the manipulation
of other parameters as the spin (quite easy to handle with a magnetic ﬁeld). We
suggest that energy conservation could be accompanied by a modiﬁcation of the
dynamical parameters that deﬁes imagination. After mass inversion, a new modi-
ﬁcation of parameters, when the craft owns a negative mass, could give it in the
positive realm a velocity vector oriented in another direction, while the length of
the vector and the kinetic momentum would be conserved. If such thing is possible,
a positive mass observer would see the craft performing turns at right angles, or
a total inversion of its velocity, both incompatible with the conventional laws of
physics.

If, in a distant future, technical progress makes it possible for a craft to travel
between stars in times comparable with human life duration, what would the trav-
elers see through the windows when they go over the negative world? They could
no longer see the Universe of positive mass. They could not see planets, stars or
galaxies. Instead, being able to capture images mediated by photons of negative
energy, it would be possible for them to see the distant fuzzy spheroidal clusters of
negative mass emitting weakly, like proto-stars, reddish and infrared light.
