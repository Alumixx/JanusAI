Abstract 
 
After a short summary of our bimetric model of the Universe, an exact nonlinear solution is 
built, which demonstrates the existence of solutions for our two coupled field equations system. 
In addition to the classical positive gravitational lensing, this solution is shown to also lead to 
negative gravitational lensing, a phenomenon previously  described in 1995 (Astrophysics and 
Space Science, reference [10]). Such negative lensing provides an alternative interpretation for 
the observed faint magnitudes of high redshift galaxies, so far considered as dwarf galaxies.

1 – Introduction 
 
In  a  previous  paper  [12]  we  evoked  the  principle  of  conjugated  metrics,  which  we  briefly 
summarize hereafter. Let us give the Universe a four-dimensional pseudo-riemannian manifold 
of signature (+ - - -). T is a tensor density defined on this manifold, and S+ is the Einstein tensor 
which is the gradient of the Hilbert functional in the metrics space, as:  
(1)

where R+ is the scalar curvature. We can write Einstein's equation with a zero cosmological 
constant: 
(2) 

 
the solution of which is a metric named g+ hereafter. Similarly, we call g– the conjugated metric 
solution of the equation:  
(3) 

S+ = χ T 

S - = -  χ T 

 
 
and we thus have a system made of two coupled field equations.

2 – Exact solution as conjugated metrics.  
 
Now we build a solution for this system, which we suppose stationary. We particularize the 
tensor density T  by making it describe an portion of space where the matter density  ρ+  is 
constant inside a sphere of radius ro. Then a solution to equation (2) is what is known as the 
interior Schwarzschild metric:  
(4) 
 

 

 

 
Positive mass particles and zero-mass positive-energy particles will follow the geodesics built 
from this metric, however only if they do not interact with positive mass matter contained in the 
sphere of radius ro , which could be the case if the particles are neutrinos because they interact 
very weakly with matter.  
 
If all calculations are taken from start in order to build a solution to equation (3), it appears the 
expression  is  the  same,  where ρ +  is  changed  into  –ρ +.  Hence,  we  write  the  interior  metric 
related to the negative energy species: 
(5) 

 
Imagine  that  the  sphere  of  radius  ro,  containing  positive  mass  matter,  is  surrounded  by  an 
extremely rarefied medium. We do not use the term "vacuum" because the perfect vacuum does 
not  exist  in  astrophysics.  A  perfect  vacuum  implies  a  region  of  space  where  none  material 
particle could be found. Even if we managed to eliminate any material residue, photons would 
still remain, constituting a black body  and bring their contribution to the energy-momentum 
tensor. Thus in a strict sense, the equation with zero second member

from  which  the  "exterior  Schwarzschild  solution"  is  classically  derived,  does  not  have  any 
physical  sense.  It  is  only  an  approximate  expression.  Outside  of  this  sphere  of  radius  ro  the 
solutions for the system:

where M is the matter amount inside the sphere of radius ro. Taking that fact into account, the 
geodesic system is composed by  two distinct sets :  
 

-  Geodesics  from  the  metric  g+  ,  interior,  then  exterior,  which  are  paths  followed  by 
positive  mass  and  energy  particles  (and  by  zero-mass  but  positive  energy  photons). 
There is no discontinuity  

 
-  Geodesics  from  the  metric  g-  ,  interior,  then  exterior,  which  are  paths  followed  by 

negative mass and energy particles (and by zero-mass but negative energy photons) 

 
As in the classical theory ( internal and external metrics g+ ) the continuity of the geodesics 
built from the second metric ( internal and external metrics g - )  is ensured everywhere.  
 
The paths of matter particles and photons can be integrated and calculated in both cases. For 
positive mass particles we get: 
 
(11) 

a classical formula in which u is the inverse of radial distance, ϕ the polar angle, l and h are 
parameters related to the initial kinetic energy and angular momentum, respectively. Keplerian 
trajectories are found through a Newtonian approximation. For the positive energy photons (so-
called null-geodesics ), we get (classical formula too):

which in particular gives the classical (positive) gravitational lensing : 
 
 

 

 

Trajectories of positive energy photons, deviated by a positive mass M 

 
With the metric g  – we can calculate the trajectories of negative mass particles and negative 
energy  photons.  Formulas  become  as  below,  first  for  negative  mass  particles  the  geodesics 
trajectories are also plane and given by : 
(13) 

 
 
and for the negative energy photons ( null-geodesics) :  
(14) 

 
 
A  positive  mass  M  behaves  like  a  repulsive  object  for  particles  having  a  negative  mass  and 
energy. It also creates a negative gravitational lensing, presented in 1995 in reference [9].

3 – Geodesics near a negative mass 
 
The  problem  is  completely  symmetrical.  Let  us  imagine  an  extremely  rarefied  space  region, 
except inside a sphere of radius ro filled with negative mass matter.  
 
As shown in the previous paper [12], this matter being self-attractive can form conglomerates 
of mass M and we can suppose they are filled with negative mass matter with constant density 
ρ – . As a convention we decided to represent the absolute value of this negative mass density. 
Thus for the interior metric g+  we get:  
(14) 

 
 
and for the interior metric g -  :

What is interesting here is that a negative mass and energy concentration somewhere in space 
must create a negative gravitational lensing on background objects:  
 

 

Trajectories of positive energy photons, deviated by a negative mass 

 
 
 
Nota bene:  
 
As shown in the preceding paper matter with negative mass ( and negative  energy ) is self-
attractive through gravitational force. Two negative masses attract each other through Newton’s 
law. Opposite masses repel each other through (anti-Newton’s law).  
 
But  positive  mass  and  negative  mass  cannot  interact  through  electromagnetic  force.  That’s 
therefore we cannot detect negative mass through optical observation. For an observer made of 
positive  energy  matter  the  negative  energy  matter  is  a  new  kind  of    “  black  matter  “.  Its 
existence can be evidenced only through gravitational effects, gravitational lensing. To sum up 
:  
 

-  The  positive  energy  mass  concentrations  produce  positive  lensing  effect  on  positive 
energy  photons,  emitted  by  positive  energy  masses,  measured  by  positive  energy 
receivers and observers ( classical gravitational lensing effect ).

-  The  negative  energy  mass  concentrations  produce  positive  energy  lensing  effect  on 
negative  energy  photons,  emitted  by  negative  masses,  measured  by  negative  energy 
receivers and observers ( if they exist ).  

 
-  The negative energy mass concentrations cannot be optically observed by positive mass 
receivers or positive mass observers, because such receivers or observers cannot receive 
negative energy photons, emitted by such negative mass concentrations.  

-  The positive energy mass concentrations cannot be optically observed by negative mass 
receivers  or  negative  mass  observers  (  if  they  exist  ),  because  such  receivers  or 
observers  cannot  receive  positive  energy  photons,  emitted  by  such  positive  mass 
concentrations.  

-  The  positive  energy  photons,  emitted  by  positive  masses  experience  a  negative 

gravitational lensing, due to the presence of negative mass concentrations.  

-  The  negative  energy  photons,  emitted  by  negative  masses  experience  a  negative 

gravitational lensing, due to the presence of positive mass concentrations.  

 
For  receivers  or  observers  made  of  positive  matter,  negative  masses  behave  like  invisible 
objects.  
 
For  receivers or observers ( if they exist ) made of negative matter, positive masses behave like 
invisible objects.  
 
We can assume that negative masses could interact through weak and strong forces and form 
negative energy nuclei, atoms, molecules. Following this idea The world of negative mass and 
negative energy particles would be  completely symmetric from ours in the way these particles 
interact. But its structures would be fully  different. It would have no stars, no heavy atoms, no 
living beings, as it will be discussed in another paper.  
 
 
The  interaction  between  both  worlds  would  only  exist  through  gravity.  Notice  the  incident 
object (mass particle or photon) could cross the deflecting object which has opposite mass and 
energy, and we can draw:

by a conglomerate made of opposite energy particles. 

 

 
This would reduce  the apparent flux and size  of background objects, exactly like a diverging 
lens does.

Such phenomena are effectively observed: the farthest galaxies are seen as "dwarf", i.e. with 
fainter magnitudes because of invisible negative mass conglomerates along the light ray paths.  
 
 
4 – On the difficult mental picturing of a bimetric Universe  
 
We could decide to avoid any mental picturing and accept to sense the Universe only through 
metrics and equations. But there are different ways to imagine a world populated by two kinds 
of matter which would not optically see each other. For example, the draughts. The game is 
played only on black squares, so half the draughtboard is unemployed. One can imagine that 
two other players would play another game concurrently on the same board, but using the white 
 squares. Imagine a draughts club having a room for "Men's Singles" and another for "Women's 
Singles". But due to lack of place the club direction decides the championships will now take 
place in the same room and on unique draughtboards, the men playing on the black squares and 
women on the white ones. To prevent any trouble, they are even fitted with polarized glasses, 
and  polarized  lights  illuminate  the  pieces  in  order  for  the  players  to  see  only  theirs,  being 
unaware of what is played in the perpendicular game. 
 
Pushing this idea to the limits we could imagine a "3D draughts" with black and white cubes : 
  

 

3D draughts 

 

 
In a book published in 1997 in French, entitled "On a perdu la moitié de l’univers" (We have 
lost one half of the Universe) I even suggested a mental image in which the game would be 
played on an elastic flabby draughtboard, so as players would perceive the presence of other 
pieces, but without seeing them.

The "flabby draughtboard" 

 
This  would  be  a  way  to  suggest  the  contribution  of  some  (positive)  "dark  matter"  to  the 
gravitational field. But it does not solve the problem of two metrics. As we saw it, two points A 
and B, stationary in space (i.e. comoving) give two distinct length measurements AB depending 
on the metric used.  
 
It is impossible to give a mental image with a single space framework. Consider a 2D word. 
The solution consists to show three surfaces. The first is a plane, it is the Euclidean Universe 
which is our intuitive mental picturing. We are completely inside a Platonic vision, in the well 
known  allegory  of  the  cave.  We  are  constrained  to  adopt  this  point  of  view  about  things. 
Indeed, for any cosmic configuration there are always two universe patterns: 
 

-  The perception of an observer that would be made of positive matter 
-  The perception of an observer that would be made of negative matter 

 
Perceptions,  measurements    of  lengths  are  different.  We  are  like  inhabitants  of  Plato's  cave, 
observing "Euclidean shadows" of phenomena inscribed into two structured hypersurfaces, one 
with the metric g+ and the other with the metric g - .  
 
So let us consider a universe whose "bigeometry" is conditioned by contents of  
 

-  Energy-matter with positive value, related to tensor T + 
-  Energy-matter with negative value, related to tensor T - 

 
according to the coupled field equations system ( [9], [10], [11], [12] ) :

the  scalar  curvatures  R+  and  R  –  are  opposite.    This  is  the  very  basis  of  our  conjugated 
geometries, or conjugated metrics, a characteristic that allows us to suggest a didactic model 
providing a good mental picturing. 
 
Let us give a two dimensional image of conjugated hypersurface. 
 
Everybody knows how to build a cone, by cutting an angle θ into a disc, then resticking both 
edges. We shall see farther why we call this object a posicone.  
 

 

Posicone 

 

 
 
If we draw a triangle thanks to geodesics, either the vertex S will not be outside that triangle 
(then the sum of its angles will be equal to π ), or the vertex will be inside the triangle (and that 
sum  will  be  equal  to π + θ );  the  Euclidean  sum  will  be  increased  with  the  cut  angle  which 
enabled to create the cone. The vertex S is called a concentrated curvature point. But we can 
smooth the cone, blunt it, i.e. spread the curvature along a spherical cap. A boilermaker who 
wishes to build a blunt cone with two basic objects: 
 

-  A sheet cone with a concentrated curvature θ 
-  A sphere 

 
could manage to manufacture it without breaking geodesics, i.e. with no break in the tangent 
plane. He must know that the total curvature of a sphere S2 is 4π. So he starts to saw a spherical 
cap in order for it to contain an equivalent angular curvature. The cap surface is:

The angle θ is defined in radians. This makes possible to finalize the object. Then the artisan 
knows the cap perimeter, surface to edge, and puts it  into his posicone to finalize the blunt 
posicone.

Blunt posicone 

 
We have built a surface where the conical frustum has zero curvature and the spherical cap has 
a constant positive curvature. The following picture illustrates a cone going from a blunt state 
to a true conical shape, with a concentrated curvature point: 
 
 
 

 

 

Concept of a concentrated curvature point 

 
 
 
Let us now introduce our representation space, our Euclidean mental Universe, the "cave" upon 
which we represent this first family of objects identified by their trajectories:

The trajectories crossing this mass would apply to neutrinos 

 
Then, how can we build a conjugated surface, having, point to point, an opposite curvature?  
Let us start by making a negacone, whose vertex is a negative curvature concentrated point.

With the posicone it was easy to obtain a conical frustum by cutting the cone along a line made 
of points equidistant from the vertex. We can do the same thing with a negacone. Hereafter a 
negaconical frustum put flat on plane.  
 
 
 

Negaconical frustum, put flat 

 
 
 
The negacone is a relatively perplexing object, even when we have one in hands. It is never 
useless to build one and to handle it, even for an experienced geometer. 
The blunt negacone will be built by connecting a horse saddle  ( constant negative curvature 
surface ) on the negaconical frustum.

How  to  measure  the  negative  curvature  quantity  inside  such  a  negachip?  By  sticking  on  its 
circular edge a negaconical frustum, trying to preserve the continuity of the tangent plane.  
 

Page 15 of 19

Finding  some  glue  able  to  fix  such  a  fatty  object  is  difficult.  Moreover  the  edge  of  these 
negachips is not circular. We can roughly determine the center of mass of the object then trace 
geodesic arcs up to its edge. These arcs will be as meridian arcs starting from the "pole" of the 
spherical cap, the experiment showing they have various lengths. This is why the central hole in 
the above illustration is elliptic and not circular, so as the negacone can be adjusted into the 
negaconical frustum.  
 
This handling provides a rough estimate of the european negachip negative curvature:  
 

 
One  could  wonder  if  this  experiment,  a  bit  like  a  comic  strip,  is  adequate  in  a  scientific 
publication. Experience has shown not everybody sees well into space, and do not immediately 
understand 3D drawings. In this case the experiment helps a lot.

The opposite curvature shape would be a blunt posicone whose spherical cap contains a +22° 
curvature.  Then  we  would  have  two  conjugated  surfaces  having  opposite  local  curvatures. 
They could be associated like in the illustration below.  
  

Thanks to that object, we are able to understand two conjugated surfaces. 

 
The first has an area with a constant positive curvature, surrounded by an Euclidean surface 
with no curvature. Then the conjugated surface is put in front of it, where the curvature is, point 
to point, opposite. 
 
 
 

 
 

 

Conjugated surfaces (with opposite curvatures) 

 
 
Suppose the upper surface is related to the metric g  + . For us, "Euclidean observers", matter 
trajectories  we  can  see  tell  us  the  grayed  area  contains  some  attractive,  positive  mass 
concentration. From that metric we can calculate the geometric tensor S + and deduce the metric 
g – from the relation  
(21) 

 
 
From the curvature field of the first surface, we can deduce the conjugated curvature field of 
the second one.  
 

S - = - S +

Then we can imagine the opposite situation: the matter is supposed to be now located in the 
second surface, upon which are inscribed the trajectories of negative energy particles.
