Abstract

When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by
gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have
assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of
1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center
of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission
ring with a diameter of 42±3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a ﬂux
ratio 10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and
width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is
consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in
brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to
the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M=(6.5±0.7)×109 Me. Our radio-
wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies
and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme
limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.

1. Introduction

Black holes are a fundamental prediction of the theory of
general relativity (GR; Einstein 1915). A deﬁning feature of
black holes is their event horizon, a one-way causal boundary in
spacetime from which not even light can escape (Schwarzschild
1916). The production of black holes is generic in GR (Penrose
1965), and more than a century after Schwarzschild, they remain
at the heart of fundamental questions in unifying GR with
quantum physics (Hawking 1976; Giddings 2017).

Black holes are common in astrophysics and are found over
a wide range of masses. Evidence for stellar-mass black holes
comes from X-ray (Webster & Murdin 1972; Remillard &
McClintock 2006)
and gravitational-wave measurements
(Abbott et al. 2016). Supermassive black holes, with masses
from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, are thought to
exist in the centers of nearly all galaxies(Lynden-Bell 1969;
Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Miyoshi et al. 1995), including
in the Galactic center (Eckart & Genzel 1997; Ghez et al. 1998;
Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018a) and in the nucleus of the
nearby elliptical galaxy M87 (Gebhardt et al. 2011; Walsh et al.
2013).

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are central bright regions that
can outshine the entire stellar population of their host galaxy.
Some of these objects, quasars, are the most luminous steady
sources in the universe (Schmidt 1963; Sanders et al. 1989) and
are thought
to be powered by supermassive black holes
accreting matter at very high rates through a geometrically thin,

optically thick accretion disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Sun &
Malkan 1989). In contrast, most AGNs in the local universe,
including the Galactic center and M87, are associated with
supermassive black holes fed by hot, tenuous accretion ﬂows
with much lower accretion rates (Ichimaru 1977; Narayan & Yi
1995; Blandford & Begelman 1999; Yuan & Narayan 2014).
In many AGNs, collimated relativistic plasma jets (Bridle &
Perley 1984; Zensus 1997) launched by the central black hole
contribute to the observed emission. These jets may be
powered either by magnetic ﬁelds threading the event horizon,
extracting the rotational energy from the black hole (Blandford
& Znajek 1977), or from the accretion ﬂow (Blandford &
Payne 1982). The near-horizon emission from low-luminosity
active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs; Ho 1999) is produced by
synchrotron radiation that peaks from the radio through the far-
infrared. This emission may be produced either in the accretion
ﬂow (Narayan et al. 1995), the jet (Falcke et al. 1993), or both
(Yuan et al. 2002).

hole. The photon capture radius is larger than the Schwarzschild
radius RS that marks the event horizon of a nonrotating black
hole, RS ≡ 2 rg. Photons approaching the black hole with an
impact parameter b<Rc are captured and plunge into the black
hole (Hilbert 1917); photons with b>Rc escape to inﬁnity;
photons with b=Rc are captured on an unstable circular orbit
and produce what is commonly referred to as the lensed “photon
ring.” In the Kerr (1963) metric, which describes black holes
with spin angular momentum, Rc changes with the ray’s
orientation relative to the angular-momentum vector, and
the black hole’s cross section is not necessarily circular

(Bardeen 1973). This change is small (4%), but potentially
detectable (Takahashi 2004; Johannsen & Psaltis 2010).
The simulations of Luminet (1979) showed that for a black
hole embedded in a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion
disk,
the photon capture radius would appear to a distant
observer as a thin emission ring inside a lensed image of the
accretion disk. For accreting black holes embedded in a
geometrically thick, optically thin emission region, as in
LLAGNs,
the combination of an event horizon and light
bending leads to the appearance of a dark “shadow” together
with a bright emission ring that should be detectable through
very long baseline interferometery (VLBI) experiments (Falcke
et al. 2000a). Its shape can appear as a “crescent” because of
fast rotation and relativistic beaming (Falcke et al. 2000b;
Bromley et al. 2001; Noble et al. 2007; Broderick & Loeb
2009; Kamruddin & Dexter 2013; Lu et al. 2014).

The observed projected diameter of the emission ring, which
contains radiation primarily from the gravitationally lensed
photon ring, is proportional to Rc and hence to the mass of the
black hole, but also depends nontrivially on a number of
factors: the observing resolution, the spin vector of the black
hole and its inclination, as well as the size and structure of the
emitting region. These factors are typically of order unity and
can be calibrated using theoretical models.

Modern general-relativistic simulations of accretion ﬂows
and radiative transfer produce realistic images of black hole
shadows and crescents for a wide range of near-horizon
emission models (Broderick & Loeb 2006; Mościbrodzka et al.
2009; Dexter et al. 2012; Dibi et al. 2012; Chan et al. 2015;
Mościbrodzka et al. 2016; Porth et al. 2017; Chael et al. 2018a;
Ryan et al. 2018; Davelaar et al. 2019). These images can be
used to test basic properties of black holes as predicted in GR
(Johannsen & Psaltis 2010; Broderick et al. 2014; Psaltis et al.
2015), or in alternative theories of gravity (Grenzebach et al.
2014; Younsi et al. 2016; Mizuno et al. 2018). They can also be
used to test alternatives to black holes (Bambi & Freese 2009;
Vincent et al. 2016; Olivares et al. 2019).

VLBI at an observing wavelength of 1.3 mm (230 GHz) with
Earth-diameter-scale baselines is required to resolve the shadows of
the core of M87 (M87* hereafter) and of the Galactic center of
Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*, Balick & Brown 1974), the two super-
massive black holes with the largest apparent angular sizes
(Johannsen et al. 2012). At 1.3 mm and shorter wavelengths, Earth-
diameter VLBI baselines achieve an angular resolution sufﬁcient to
resolve the shadow of both sources, while the spectra of both
sources become optically thin, thus revealing the structure of the
innermost emission region. Early pathﬁnder experiments (Padin
et al. 1990; Krichbaum et al. 1998) demonstrated the feasibility of
VLBI techniques at ∼1.3 mm wavelengths. Over the following
decade, a program to improve sensitivity of 1.3 mm-VLBI through
development of broadband instrumentation led to the detection of
event-horizon-scale structures in both Sgr A* and M87* (Doeleman
et al. 2008, 2012). Building on these observations, the Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration was established to
assemble a global VLBI array operating at a wavelength of
1.3 mm with the required angular resolution, sensitivity, and
baseline coverage to image the shadows in M87* and Sgr A*.

In this paper, we present and discuss the ﬁrst event-horizon-
scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate M87*
from an EHT VLBI campaign conducted in 2017 April at a
wavelength of 1.3 mm. The accompanying papers give a more
extensive description of the instrument (EHT Collaboration

models (EHT Collaboration et al. 2019d, hereafter Paper V),
and the black hole mass estimate (EHT Collaboration et al.
2019e, hereafter Paper VI).

2. The Radio Core in M87

In Curtis (1918), Heber Curtis detected a linear feature in
M87, later called a “jet” by Baade & Minkowski (1954). The
jet is seen as a bright radio source, VirgoA or 3C 274 (Bolton
et al. 1949; Kassim et al. 1993; Owen et al. 2000), which
extends out to 65 kpc with an age estimated at about 40 Myr
and a kinetic power of about 1042 to 1045 erg s−1 (de Gasperin
et al. 2012; Broderick et al. 2015). It is also well studied in the
optical (Biretta et al. 1999; Perlman et al. 2011), X-ray
(Marshall et al. 2002), and gamma-ray bands (Abramowski
et al. 2012). The upstream end of the jet is marked by a
compact radio source (Cohen et al. 1969). Such compact radio
sources are ubiquitous in LLAGNs (Wrobel & Heeschen 1984;
Nagar et al. 2005) and are believed to be signatures of
supermassive black holes.

The radio structures of the large-scale jet (Owen et al. 1989;
de Gasperin et al. 2012) and of the core of M87 (Reid et al.
1989; Junor et al. 1999; Hada et al. 2016; Mertens et al. 2016;
Kim et al. 2018b; Walker et al. 2018) have been resolved in
great detail and at multiple wavelengths. Furthermore,
the
leveling-off of the “core-shift” effect (Blandford & Königl
1979), where the apparent position of the radio core shifts in
the upstream jet direction with decreasing wavelength from
increased transparency to synchrotron self-absorption, indicates
that at a wavelength of 1.3 mm M87* is coincident with the
supermassive black hole (Hada et al. 2011). The envelope of
the jet limb maintains a quasi-parabolic shape over a wide
range of distances from ∼105 rg down to ∼20 rg (Asada &
Nakamura 2012; Hada et al. 2013; Nakamura & Asada 2013;
Nakamura et al. 2018; Walker et al. 2018).

VLBI observations at 1.3 mm have revealed a diameter of the
emission region of ∼40 μas, which is comparable to the expected
horizon-scale structure (Doeleman et al. 2012; Akiyama et al.
2015). These observations, however, were not able to image the
black hole shadow due to limited baseline coverage.

Based on three recent stellar population measurements, we here
adopt a distance to M87 of 16.8±0.8 Mpc (Blakeslee et al. 2009;
Bird et al. 2010; Cantiello et al. 2018, see Paper VI). Using this
distance and the modeling of surface brightness and stellar velocity
dispersion at optical wavelengths (Gebhardt & Thomas 2009;
Gebhardt et al. 2011), we infer the mass of M87* to be

3. The Event Horizon Telescope
The EHT (Paper II) is a VLBI experiment

that directly
measures “visibilities,” or Fourier components, of the radio
brightness distribution on the sky. As the Earth rotates, each
telescope pair in the network samples many spatial frequencies.

2

The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 875:L1 (17pp), 2019 April 10
The array has a nominal angular resolution of λ/L, where λ is the
observing wavelength and L is the maximum projected baseline
length between telescopes in the array (Thompson et al. 2017). In
this way, VLBI creates a virtual telescope that spans nearly the
full diameter of the Earth.

To measure interferometric visibilities, the widely separated
telescopes simultaneously sample and coherently record the
radiation ﬁeld from the source. Synchronization using the
Global Positioning System typically achieves temporal align-
ment of these recordings within tens of nanoseconds. Each
station is equipped with a hydrogen maser frequency standard.
With the atmospheric conditions during our observations the
coherent integration time was typically 10 s (see Figure 2 in
Paper II). Use of hydrogen maser frequency standards at all
EHT sites ensures coherence across the array over
this
timescale. After observations, recordings are staged at a central
location, aligned in time, and signals from each telescope-pair
are cross-correlated.

While VLBI is well established at centimeter and millimeter
wavelengths (Boccardi et al. 2017; Thompson et al. 2017) and
can be used to study the immediate environments of black holes
(Krichbaum et al. 1993; Doeleman et al. 2001), the extension of
VLBI to a wavelength of 1.3 mm has required long-term
technical developments. Challenges at shorter wavelengths
include increased noise in radio receiver electronics, higher
atmospheric opacity,
increased phase ﬂuctuations caused by
atmospheric turbulence, and decreased efﬁciency and size of
radio telescopes in the millimeter and submillimeter observing
bands. Started in 2009 (Doeleman et al. 2009a), the EHT began
a program to address these challenges by increasing array
sensitivity. Development and deployment of broadband VLBI
systems (Whitney et al. 2013; Vertatschitsch et al. 2015) led to
data recording rates that now exceed those of typical cm-VLBI
arrays by more than an order of magnitude. Parallel efforts to

Pole Telescope (SPT) in Antarctica (Kim et al. 2018a), extended
the range of EHT baselines and coverage, and the overall
collecting area of the array. These developments increased the
sensitivity of the EHT by a factor of ∼30 over early experiments
that conﬁrmed horizon-scale structures in M87* and Sgr A*
(Doeleman et al. 2008, 2012; Akiyama et al. 2015; Johnson et al.
2015; Fish et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2018).

infrastructure upgrades at additional VLBI

For the observations at a wavelength of 1.3 mm presented
here, the EHT collaboration ﬁelded a global VLBI array of
eight stations over six geographical locations. Baseline lengths
ranged from 160 m to 10,700 km toward M87*, resulting in an
array with a theoretical diffraction-limit resolution of ∼25 μas
(see Figures 1 and 2, and Paper II).

4. Observations, Correlation, and Calibration

EHT. Weather was uniformly good to excellent with nightly

median zenith atmospheric opacities at 230 GHz ranging from
0.03 to 0.28 over the different locations. The observations were
scheduled as a series of scans of three to seven minutes in
duration, with M87* scans interleaved with those on the quasar
3C 279. The number of scans obtained on M87* per night
ranged from 7 (April 10) to 25 (April 6) as a result of different
observing schedules. A description of the M87* observations,
their correlation, calibration, and validated ﬁnal data products is
presented in Paper III and brieﬂy summarized here.

At each station, the astronomical signal in both polarizations
and two adjacent 2 GHz wide frequency bands centered at
227.1 and 229.1 GHz were converted to baseband using
standard heterodyne techniques, then digitized and recorded
at atotal rate of 32 Gbps. Correlation of the data was carried
out using a software correlator (Deller et al. 2007) at the MIT
Haystack Observatory and at
für
Radioastronomie, each handling one of the two frequency
bands. Differences between the two independent correlators
were shown to be negligible through the exchange of a few
identical scans for cross comparison. At correlation, signals
were aligned to a common time reference using an apriori
Earth geometry and clock model.

each tailored to the speciﬁc characteristics of
the EHT
observations, such as the wide bandwidth, susceptibility to
atmospheric turbulence, and array heterogeneity (Blackburn et al.
2019; Janssen et al. 2019, Paper III). The pipelines made use of
standard software for the processing of radio-interferometric data

and phase. Comparisons between the three independent
pipelines, the two polarizations, and the two frequency bands
enabled estimation of systematic baseline errors of around 1° in
visibility phase and 2% for visibility amplitudes. These small
limiting errors remain after ﬁtting station sensitivities and
unknown station phases via self-calibration (Pearson & Readhead
1984) and affect interferometric closure quantities (Rogers et al.
1974; Readhead et al. 1980). Following data validation and
pipeline comparisons, a single pipeline output was designated as
the primary data set of the ﬁrst EHT science data release and used
for subsequent results, while the outputs of the other two pipelines
offer supporting validation data sets.

The ﬁnal calibrated complex visibilities V(u, v) correspond to
the Fourier components of the brightness distribution on the
sky at spatial frequency (u, v) determined by the projected
baseline expressed in units of the observing wavelength (van
Cittert 1934; Thompson et al. 2017). Figure 2 shows the (u, v)
coverage and calibrated visibility amplitudes of M87* for
April11. The visibility amplitudes resemble those of a thin
ring (i.e., a Bessel function J0; see Figure 10.12 in Thompson
et al. 2017). Such a ring model with diameter 46 μas has aﬁrst
null at 3.4 Gλ, matching the minimum in observed ﬂux density
and is consistent with a reduced ﬂux density on the longest
(JCMT/SMA-PV) near 8 Gλ. This
Hawai’i–Spain baseline
particular ring model, shown with a dashed line in the bottom
panel of Figure 2, is only illustrative and does not ﬁt all features
in the data. First, visibility amplitudes on the shortest VLBI
baselines suggest that about half of the compact ﬂux density
seen on the ∼2 km ALMA–APEX baseline is resolved out by
the interferometer beam (Paper IV). Second, differences in the
depth of the ﬁrst minimum as a function of orientation, as well
as highly nonzero measured closure phases,
indicate some
degree of asymmetry in the source (Papers III, VI). Finally, the
visibility amplitudes represent only half of the information
available to us. We will next explore images and more complex

5. Images and Features

IV). However,

We reconstructed images from the calibrated EHT visibi-
lities, which provide results that are independent of models
(Paper
there are two major challenges in
reconstructing images from EHT data. First, EHT baselines
sample a limited range of spatial frequencies, corresponding to
angular scales between 25 and 160 μas. Because the (u, v)
plane is only sparsely sampled (Figure 2), the inverse problem
is under-constrained. Second, the measured visibilities lack
absolute phase calibration and can have large amplitude
calibration uncertainties.

To address these challenges, imaging algorithms incorporate
additional assumptions and constraints that are designed to produce
images that are physically plausible (e.g., positive and compact) or
conservative (e.g., smooth), while remaining consistent with the
data. We explored two classes of algorithms for reconstructing
images from EHT data. The ﬁrst class of algorithms is the
traditional CLEAN approach used in radio interferometry (e.g.,
Högbom 1974; Clark 1980). CLEAN is an inverse-modeling
approach that deconvolves the interferometer point-spread function
from the Fourier-transformed visibilities. When applying CLEAN, it
is necessary to iteratively self-calibrate the data between rounds of
imaging to solve for time-variable phase and amplitude errors in the
data. The second class of algorithms is the so-called regularized

Data from the fringe-ﬁtting pipelines were scaled from
correlation coefﬁcients to a uniform physical ﬂux density scale
(in Jansky) by using an independent apriori estimate of the
sensitivity of each telescope. The accuracies of the derived
station sensitivities were estimated to be 5%–10% in amplitude,
although certain uncharacterized losses
from poor
pointing or focus) can exceed the error budget. By assuming
total ﬂux density values derived from ALMA interferometric
data (Goddi et al. 2019) and utilizing array redundancy via
network calibration (Paper
III), we reﬁned the absolute
amplitude calibration of telescopes that are colocated and have
redundant baselines, i.e., ALMA/APEX and JCMT/SMA.

The median scan-averaged signal-to-noise ratio for M87*
was >10 on non-ALMA baselines and >100 on baselines to
ALMA, leading to small statistical errors in visibility amplitude

maximum likelihood (RML; e.g., Narayan & Nityananda 1986;
Wiaux et al. 2009; Thiébaut 2013). RML is a forward-modeling
approach that searches for an image that is not only consistent with
the observed data but also favors speciﬁed image properties (e.g.,
smoothness or compactness). As with CLEAN, RML methods
typically iterate between imaging and self-calibration, although
they can also be used to image directly on robust closure quantities
immune to station-based calibration errors. RML methods have been
extensively developed for the EHT (e.g., Honma et al. 2014;
Bouman et al. 2016; Akiyama et al. 2017; Chael et al. 2018b; see
also Paper IV).

these parameters.

Every imaging algorithm has a variety of free parameters
that can signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁnal image. We adopted a two-
stage imaging approach to control and evaluate biases in the
reconstructions from our choices of
In
the ﬁrst stage, four teams worked independently to reconstruct
the ﬁrst EHT images of M87* using an early engineering data
release. The teams worked without interaction to minimize
shared bias, yet each produced an image with a similar
feature: a ring of diameter ∼38–44 μas with
prominent
enhanced brightness to the south (see Figure 4 in Paper IV).
In the second imaging stage, we developed three imaging
pipelines, each using a different
software package and
associated methodology. Each pipeline surveyed a range of
imaging parameters, producing between ∼103 and 104 images
from different parameter combinations. We determined a “Top-
Set” of parameter combinations that both produced images of
M87* that were consistent with the observed data and that
reconstructed accurate images
from synthetic data sets
corresponding to four known geometric models (ring, crescent,
ﬁlled disk, and asymmetric double source). For all pipelines,
the Top-Set images showed an asymmetric ring with a diameter
of ∼40 μas, with differences arising primarily in the effective
angular resolutions achieved by different methods.

For each pipeline, we determined the single combination of
ﬁducial imaging parameters out of the Top-Set that performed
best across all the synthetic data sets and for each associated
imaging methodology (see Figure 11 in Paper IV). Because the
angular resolutions of the reconstructed images vary among the
pipelines, we blurred each image with a circular Gaussian to a
common, conservative angular resolution of 20 μas. The top part
of Figure 3 shows an image of M87* on April11 obtained by
averaging the three pipelines’ blurred ﬁducial images. The image
is dominated by a ring with an asymmetric azimuthal proﬁle that
is oriented at a position angle ∼170° east of north. Although the
measured position angle increases by ∼20° between the ﬁrst two
days and the last
the image features are broadly
consistent across the different imaging methods and across all
four observing days. This is shown in the bottom part of Figure 3,
which reports the images on different days (see also Figure 15 in
Paper IV). These results are also consistent with those obtained
from visibility-domain ﬁtting of geometric and general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) models (Paper VI).

6. Theoretical Modeling

The appearance of M87* has been modeled successfully using

disk orbiting a Kerr black hole. They naturally produce a powerful
jet and can explain the broadband spectral energy distribution

observed here, the simulations also predict a shadow and an
asymmetric emission ring. The latter does not necessarily coincide

related to the lensed photon ring. To explore this scenario in great
detail, we have built a library of synthetic images (Image Library)
describing magnetized accretion ﬂows onto black holes in GR145
(Paper V). The images themselves are produced from a library
of simulations (Simulation Library) collecting the results of
four codes solving the equations of GRMHD (Gammie et al.

description of the initial setups and the physical scenarios
explored in the simulations; see Paper V for details on both the
GRMHD and GRRT codes, which have been cross-validated

gravastars, have also been considered (Paper V).

A typical GRMHD simulation in the library is characterized by
two parameters: the dimensionless spin a
, where J
and M are, respectively, the spin angular momentum and mass of
the black hole, and the net dimensionless magnetic ﬂux over the
, where Φ and M˙ are the magnetic
event horizon
ﬂux and mass ﬂux (or accretion rate) across the horizon,
respectively. Since the GRMHD simulations scale with the black
hole mass, M is set only at the time of producing the synthetic
images with the GRRT codes. The magnetic ﬂux is generally
nonzero because magnetic ﬁeld is trapped in the black hole by the
accretion ﬂow and sustained by currents in the surrounding plasma.
These two parameters allow us to describe accretion disks
that are either prograde (a*0) or retrograde (a*<0) with
respect
to the black hole spin axis, and whose accretion
ﬂows are either “SANE” (from “Standard and Normal
Evolution,” Narayan et al. 2012) with f∼1, or “MAD” (from
“Magnetically Arrested Disk,” Narayan et al. 2003) with
f∼15.146 In essence, SANE accretion ﬂows are characterized
by moderate dimensionless magnetic ﬂux and result from initial
magnetic ﬁelds that are smaller than those in MAD ﬂows.
Furthermore, the opening angles of the magnetic funnel in
SANE ﬂows are generically smaller than those in MAD ﬂows.
Varying a* and f, we have performed 43 high-resolution,
three-dimensional and long-term simulations covering well the
physical properties of magnetized accretion ﬂows onto Kerr
black holes.

the further post-processing of

All GRMHD simulations were initialized with a weakly
magnetized torus orbiting around the black hole and driven into
a turbulent state by instabilities, including the magnetorotational
instability (Balbus & Hawley 1991), rapidly reaching a quasi-
stationary state. Once a simulation was completed, the relevant
ﬂow properties at different times are collected to be employed
for
the GRRT codes. The
generation of synthetic images requires, besides the properties
of the ﬂuid (magnetic ﬁeld, velocity ﬁeld, and rest-mass density),
also the emission and absorption coefﬁcients, the inclination i
(the angle between the accretion-ﬂow angular-momentum vector
and the line of sight), the position angle PA (the angle east of
north, i.e., counter-clockwise on our images, of the projection on
the sky of the accretion-ﬂow angular momentum), the black hole
mass M and distance D to the observer.

Because the photons at 1.3 mm wavelength observed by the
EHT are believed to be produced by synchrotron emission,
whose absorption and emission coefﬁcients depend on the
electron distribution function, we consider the plasma to be
composed of electrons and ions that have the same temperature
in the magnetically dominated regions of the ﬂow (funnel), but
have a substantially different temperature in the gas dominated
regions (disk midplane). In particular, we consider the plasma to
be composed of nonrelativistic ions with temperature Ti and
relativistic electrons with temperature Te. A simple prescription
for the ratio of the temperatures of the two species can then be
(Mościbrodzka et al.
imposed in terms of a single parameter
2016), such that the bulk of the emission comes either from
weakly magnetized (small Rhigh, Te ; Ti/Rhigh) or strongly
magnetized (large Rhigh, Te ; Ti) regions. In SANE models, the
disk (jet) is weakly (strongly) magnetized, so that low (high)
Rhigh models produce most of the emission in the disk (jet). In

The EHT Collaboration et al.

MAD models, there are strongly magnetized regions everywhere
and the emission is mostly from the disk midplane. While this
prescription is not the only one possible, it has the advantage of
being simple, sufﬁciently generic, and robust (see Paper V for a
discussion of nonthermal particles and radiative cooling).

Since each GRMHD simulation can be used to describe several
different physical scenarios by changing the prescribed electron
distribution function, we have used the Simulation Library to
generate more than 420 different physical scenarios. Each scenario
is then used to generate hundreds of snapshots at different times in
the simulation leading to more than 62,000 objects in the Image
Library. From the images we have created model visibilities that
correspond to the EHT observing schedule and compared them to
the measured VLBI visibilities as detailed in Paper VI.

As an example, the top row of Figure 4 shows three GRMHD
model snapshots from the Image Library with different spins and
ﬂow type, which ﬁtted closure phases and amplitudes of the
April 11 data best. For these models we produced simulated
visibilities for the April 11 schedule and weather parameters and
calibrated them with a synthetic data generation and calibration
pipeline (Blecher et al. 2017; Janssen et al. 2019; Roelofs et al.
2019a). The simulated data were then imaged with the same
pipeline used for the observed images. The similarities between
the simulated images (bottom row of Figure 4) and the observed
images (Figure 3) are remarkable.

Overall, when combining all the information contained in
both the Simulation Library and Image Library, the physical
origin of the emission features of the image observed in M87*
can be summarized as follows.

First, the observed image is consistent with the hypothesis
that it is produced by a magnetized accretion ﬂow orbiting
within a few rg of the event horizon of a Kerr black hole. The
asymmetric ring is produced by a combination of strong
gravitational lensing and relativistic beaming, while the central
ﬂux depression is the observational signature of the black hole
shadow. Interestingly, all of the accretion models are consistent
with the EHT image, except for the a*=−0.94 MAD models,
which fail to produce images that are sufﬁciently stable (i.e.,
the variance among snapshots is too large to be statistically
consistent with the observed image).

Second, the north–south asymmetry in the emission ring is
controlled by the black hole spin and can be used to deduce its
orientation. In corotating disk models (where the angular
momentum of the matter and of the black hole are aligned), the
funnel wall, or jet sheath, rotates with the disk and the black
hole; in counterrotating disk models, instead, the luminous
funnel wall rotates with the black hole but against the disk. The
north–south asymmetry is consistent with models in which the
black hole spin is pointing away from Earth and inconsistent
with models in which the spin points toward Earth.

Third, adopting an inclination of 17° between the approaching
jet and the line of sight (Walker et al. 2018), the west orientation
of the jet, and a corotating disk model, matter in the bottom part
of the image is moving toward the observer (clockwise rotation
as seen from Earth). This is consistent with the rotation of the
ionized gas on scales of 20 pc, i.e., 7000 rg (Ford et al. 1994;
Walsh et al. 2013) and with the inferred sense of rotation from
VLBI observations at 7 mm (Walker et al. 2018).

Finally, models with a*=0 are disfavored by the very
conservative observational requirement
the jet power be
Pjet>1042 erg s−1. Furthermore, in those models that produce a
sufﬁciently powerful jet, it is powered by extraction of black hole

process.

7. Model Comparison and Parameter Estimation

In Paper VI, the black hole mass is derived from ﬁtting to the
visibility data of geometric and GRMHD models, as well as
from measurements of the ring diameter in the image domain.
Our measurements remain consistent across methodologies,
algorithms, data representations, and observed data sets.

Motivated by the asymmetric emission ring structures seen in
the reconstructed images (Section 5) and the similar emission
structures seen in the images
from GRMHD simulations
(Section 6), we developed a family of geometric crescent
models(see, e.g., Kamruddin & Dexter 2013) to compare directly
to the visibility data. We used two distinct Bayesian-inference
algorithms and demonstrate that such crescent models are
statistically preferred over other comparably complex geometric
models that we have explored. We ﬁnd that the crescent models
provide ﬁts to the data that are statistically comparable to those of
the reconstructed images presented in Section 5, allowing us to
determine the basic parameters of the crescents. The best-ﬁt
models for the asymmetric emission ring have diameters of
43±0.9 μas and fractional widths relative to the diameter of
<0.5. The emission drops sharply interior to the asymmetric
emission ring with the central depression having a brightness
<10% of the average brightness in the ring.

The diameters of the geometric crescent models measure the
characteristic sizes of the emitting regions that surround the
shadows and not the sizes of the shadows themselves (see, e.g.,
Psaltis et al. 2015; Johannsen et al. 2016; Kuramochi et al.
2018, for potential biases).

We model the crescent angular diameter d in terms of the
, as d=αθg,
gravitational radius and distance,
where α is a function of spin, inclination, and Rhigh (α;9.6–10.4
corresponds to emission from the lensed photon ring only). We
calibrate α by ﬁtting the geometric crescent models to a large
number of visibility data generated from the Image Library. We
can also ﬁt the model visibilities generated from the Image Library
to the M87* data, which allows us to measure θg directly.
However, such a procedure is complicated by the stochastic nature
of the emission in the accretion ﬂow(see, e.g., Kim et al. 2016).
To account for this turbulent structure, we developed a formalism
and multiple algorithms that estimate the statistics of the stochastic
components using ensembles of images from individual GRMHD
simulations. We ﬁnd that the visibility data are not inconsistent
with being a realization of many of the GRMHD simulations. We
conclude that
the recovered model parameters are consistent
across algorithms.

Finally, we extract ring diameter, width, and shape directly
from reconstructed images (see Section 5). The results are
consistent with the parameter estimates
from geometric
crescent models. Following the same GRMHD calibration

Combining results from all methods, we measure emission
region diameters of 42±3 μas, angular sizes of the gravita-
tional radius θg=3.8±0.4 μas, and scaling factors in the
range α=10.7–11.5, with associated errors of ∼10%. For the
distance of 16.8±0.8 Mpc adopted here, the black hole mass
is M=(6.5±0.7)×109 Me; the systematic error refers to
the 68% conﬁdence level and is much larger than the statistical
error of 0.2×109 Me. Moreover, by tracing the peak of the
emission in the ring we can determine the shape of the image
and obtain a ratio between major and minor axis of the ring that
is 4:3; this corresponds to a 10% deviation from circularity
in terms of root-mean-square distance from an average radius.
Table 1 summarizes the measured parameters of the image
features and the inferred black hole properties based on data
from all bands and all days combined. The inferred black hole
mass
strongly favors the measurement based on stellar
dynamics(Gebhardt et al. 2011). The size, asymmetry, bright-
ness contrast, and circularity of the reconstructed images and
geometric models, as well as the success of the GRMHD
simulations in describing the interferometric data, are consis-
tent with the EHT images of M87* being associated with
strongly lensed emission from the vicinity of a Kerr black hole.

8. Discussion

A number of elements reinforce the robustness of our image
and the conclusion that it is consistent with the shadow of a
black hole as predicted by GR. First, our analysis has used
multiple independent calibration and imaging techniques, as
well as four independent data sets taken on four different days
in two separate frequency bands. Second, the image structure
(Dexter et al. 2012;
matches previous predictions well
Mościbrodzka et al. 2016) and is well reproduced by our
extensive modeling effort presented in Section 6. Third, because

8

The EHT Collaboration et al.
our measurement of the black hole mass in M87* is not
inconsistent with all of the prior mass measurements, this allows
us to conclude that the null hypothesis of the Kerr metric
(Psaltis et al. 2015; Johannsen et al. 2016), namely,
the
assumption that the black hole is described by the Kerr metric,
has not been violated. Fourth,
the observed emission ring
reconstructed in our images is close to circular with an axial
ratio 4:3; similarly,
the time average images from our
GRMHD simulations also show a circular shape. After
associating to the shape of the shadow a deviation from the
circularity—measured in terms of root-mean-square distance
from an average radius in the image—that is 10%, we can set
an initial
limit of order four on relative deviations of the
quadrupole moment from the Kerr value (Johannsen & Psaltis
2010). Stated differently, if Q is the quadrupole moment of a
Kerr black hole and ΔQ the deviation as deduced from
circularity, our measurement—and the fact that the inclination
angle is assumed to be small—implies that ΔQ/Q4
(ΔQ/Q=ε in Johannsen & Psaltis 2010).
Finally, when comparing the visibility amplitudes of M87*
with 2009 and 2012 data(Doeleman et al. 2012; Akiyama et al.
2015), the overall radio core size at a wavelength of 1.3 mm
has not changed appreciably, despite variability in total ﬂux
density. This stability is consistent with the expectation that the
size of the shadow is a feature tied to the mass of the black hole
and not to properties of a variable plasma ﬂow.

It is also straightforward to reject some alternative astrophysical
interpretations. For instance, the image is unlikely to be produced
by a jet-feature as multi-epoch VLBI observations of the plasma
jet in M87 (Walker et al. 2018) on scales outside the horizon do
not show circular rings. The same is typically true for AGN jets in
large VLBI surveys (Lister et al. 2018). Similarly, were the
apparent ring a random alignment of emission blobs, they should
also have moved away at relativistic speeds, i.e., at ∼5 μas day−1
(Kim et al. 2018b), leading to measurable structural changes and
sizes. GRMHD models of hollow jet cones could show under
extreme conditions stable ring features (Pu et al. 2017), but this
effect is included to a certain extent in our Simulation Library for
models with Rhigh>10. Finally, an Einstein ring formed by
gravitational lensing of a bright region in the counter-jet would
require a ﬁne-tuned alignment and a size larger than that measured
in 2012 and 2009.

At the same time, it is more difﬁcult to rule out alternatives
to black holes in GR, because a shadow can be produced by
any compact object with a spacetime characterized by unstable
circular photon orbits(Mizuno et al. 2018). Indeed, while the
Kerr metric remains a solution in some alternative theories of
gravity (Barausse & Sotiriou 2008; Psaltis et al. 2008), non-
Kerr black hole solutions do exist in a variety of such modiﬁed
theories (Berti et al. 2015). Furthermore, exotic alternatives to
black holes, such as naked singularities(Shaikh et al. 2019),
boson stars (Kaup 1968; Liebling & Palenzuela 2012), and
gravastars (Mazur & Mottola 2004; Chirenti & Rezzolla 2007),
are admissible solutions within GR and provide concrete, albeit
contrived, models. Some of such exotic compact objects can
already be shown to be incompatible with our observations
given our maximum mass prior. For example, the shadows of
naked singularities associated with Kerr spacetimes with
* >∣
a
are substantially smaller and very asymmetric
compared to those of Kerr black holes(Bambi & Freese 2009).
Also, some commonly used types of wormholes (Bambi 2013)
predict much smaller shadows than we have measured.

1

∣

The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 875:L1 (17pp), 2019 April 10

However, other compact-object candidates need to be analyzed
with more care. Boson stars are an example of compact objects
having circular photon orbits but without a surface or an event
horizon. In such a spacetime, null geodesics are redirected
outwards toward distant observers (Cunha et al. 2016), so that the
shadow can in principle be ﬁlled with emission from lensed
images of distant radio sources generating a complex mirror
image of the sky. More importantly, accretion ﬂows onto boson
stars behave differently as they do not produce jets but stalled
accretion tori that make them distinguishable from black holes
(Olivares et al. 2019). Gravastars provide examples of compact
objects having unstable photon orbits and a hard surface, but not
an event horizon. In this case, while a single image of the
accretion ﬂow could in principle be very similar to that coming
from a black hole, differences of the ﬂow dynamics at the stellar
surface (H. Olivares et al. 2019, in preparation), strong magnetic
ﬁelds (Lobanov 2017), or excess radiation in the infrared
(Broderick & Narayan 2006) would allow one to distinguish a
gravastar from a black hole.

Altogether, the results derived here provide a new way to
study compact-object spacetimes and are complementary to the
detection of gravitational waves from coalescing stellar-mass
black holes with LIGO/Virgo (Abbott et al. 2016). Our
constraints on deviations from the Kerr geometry rely only on
the validity of the equivalence principle and are agnostic about
the underlying theory of gravity, but can be used to measure,
with ever improved precision, the parameters of the back-
ground metric. On the other hand, current gravitational-wave
observations of mergers probe the dynamics of the underlying
theory, but cannot rely on the possibility of multiple and
repeated measurements of the same source.

To underline the complementarity of gravitational-wave and
electromagnetic observations of black holes, we note that a
basic feature of black holes in GR is that their size scales
linearly with mass. Combining our constraints on the super-
massive black hole in M87 with those on the stellar-mass black
holes detected via gravitational waves we can infer that this
property holds over eight orders of magnitude. While this
invariance is a basic prediction of GR, which is a scale-free
theory, it need not be satisﬁed in other theories that introduce a
scale to the gravitational ﬁeld.

Finally, the radio core in M87 is quite typical for powerful
radio jets in general. It falls on the fundamental plane of black
hole activity for radio cores (Falcke et al. 2004), connecting via
simple scaling laws the radio and X-ray properties of low-
luminosity black hole candidates across vastly different mass
and accretion rate scales. This suggests that they are powered
by a scale-invariant common object. Therefore, establishing the
black hole nature for M87* also supports the general paradigm
that black holes are the power source for active galaxies.

9. Conclusion and Outlook

independent

We have assembled the EHT, a global VLBI array operating
at a wavelength of 1.3 mm and imaged horizon-scale structures
around the supermassive black hole candidate in M87. Using
multiple
and analysis
methods, we ﬁnd the image to be dominated by a ring
structure of 42±3 μas diameter that is brighter in the south.
This structure has a central brightness depression with a
contrast of >10:1, which we identify with the black hole
shadow. Comparing the data with an extensive library of
synthetic images obtained from GRMHD simulations covering

different physical scenarios and plasma conditions reveals that
the basic features of our image are relatively independent of the
detailed astrophysical model. This allows us to derive an

109 Me. Based on our modeling and information on the
inclination angle, we derive the sense of rotation of the black
hole to be in the clockwise direction, i.e., the spin of the black
hole points away from us. The brightness excess in the south
part of the emission ring is explained as relativistic beaming of
material rotating in the clockwise direction as seen by the
observer, i.e., the bottom part of the emission region is moving
toward the observer.

test

Future observations and further analysis will

the
stability, shape, and depth of the shadow more accurately.
One of its key features is that it should remain largely constant
with time as the mass of M87* is not expected to change
measurably on human timescales. Polarimetric analysis of the
images, which we will report
in the future, will provide
information on the accretion rate via Faraday rotation (Bower
et al. 2003; Marrone et al. 2007; Kuo et al. 2014; Mościbrodzka
et al. 2017) and on the magnetic ﬂux. Higher-resolution images
can be achieved by going to a shorter wavelength, i.e., 0.8 mm
(345 GHz), by adding more telescopes and, in a more distant
future, with space-based interferometry (Kardashev et al. 2014;
Fish et al. 2019; Palumbo et al. 2019; F. Roelofs et al. 2019b,
in preparation).

Another primary EHT source, Sgr A*, has a precisely
measured mass three orders of magnitude smaller than that of
M87*, with dynamical timescales of minutes instead of days.
Observing the shadow of Sgr A* will require accounting for
this variability and mitigation of scattering effects caused by
the interstellar medium (Johnson 2016; Lu et al. 2016; Bouman
et al. 2018). Time dependent nonimaging analysis can be used
to potentially track the motion of emitting matter near the black
hole, as reported recently through interferometric observations
in the near-infrared (Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018b). Such
observations provide separate tests and probes of GR on yet
another mass scale (Broderick & Loeb 2005; Doeleman et al.
2009b; Roelofs et al. 2017; Medeiros et al. 2017).

In conclusion, we have shown that direct studies of the event
horizon shadow of supermassive black hole candidates are now
possible via electromagnetic waves,
thus transforming this
elusive boundary from a mathematical concept to a physical
entity that can be studied and tested via repeated astronomical
observations.
