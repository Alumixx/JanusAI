respect the symmetry of space inversion, so these particles are given
different names : neutrinos for helicity +1/2, and antineutrinos for helicity
-1/2.

Even though the helicity of a massless particle is Lorentz-invariant, the
state itself is not. In particular, because of the helicity-dependent phase
factor exp(i a H) in Eq. (2.5.42), a state formed as a linear superposition of
one-particle states with opposite helicities will be changed by a Lorentz
transformation into a different superposition . For instance, a general
one-photon state of four-momenta may be writte n

where

I X+I 2 + I U_ 11 = 1 .

The generic case is one of elliptic polarization, with Ioc+ I both non-zero and
unequal. Circular polarization is the limiting case where either Y+ or x_
vanishes, and linear polarization is the opposite extreme, with a+ = la-1 .
The overall phase of ac+ and a_ has no physical significance, and for linear
polarization may be adjusted so that ac_ = a+, but the relative phase is
still important. Indeed, for linear polarizations with a_ = a+, the phase
of ac+ may be identified as the angle between the plane of polarization
and some fixed reference direction perpendicular to p. Eq. (2.5.42) shows
that under a Lorentz transformation A,,, this angle rotates by an amount
B(11> p). Plane polarized gravitons can be defined in a similar way, and
here Eq. (2.5.42) has the consequence that a Lorentz transformation A
rotates the plane of polarization by an angle 20 (A, P) •

Space Inversion and Time-Reversal

We saw in Section 2.3 that any homogeneous Lorentz transformation is
either proper and orthochronous (i .e., DetA :;-- +1 and AOO > +1) or
else equal to a proper orthochronous transformation times either : or
9- or Y g-, where 9 and JV are the space inversion and time-reversal
transformations

It used to be thought self-evident that the fundamental multiplication rule
of the Poincare group

would be valid even if A and/or A involved factors of ~P or °l or 503T.
In particular, it was believed that there are operators corresponding to

such that

for any proper orthochronous Lorentz transformation 11P, and translation
aP. These transformation rules incorporate most of what is meant when
we say that P or T are 'conserved'.
In 1956-57 it became understaod8 that this is true for P only in the
approximation in which one ignores the effects of weak interactions, such
as those that produce nuclear beta decay . Time-reversal survived for a
while, but in 1964 there appeared indirect evidence9 that these properties
of T are also only approximately satisfied. (See Section 3.3.)
In what
follows, we will make believe that operators P and T satisfying Sys . (2-6-1)
and (2.6.2) actually exist, but it should be kept in mind that this is only
an approximation .

coefficients of r~),o¢ and eP i n Eqs. (2.6.1 ) and (2.6.2), we obtain the P and

This is much like Eqs. (2.4.8) and (2.4.9), except that we have not cancelled
factors of i on both sides of these equations, because at this point we have
not yet decided whether P and T are linear and unitary or antilinear an d
antiunitary-

The decision is an easy one . Setting p = 0 in Eq . (2.6.4) gives

P i HPR t = i H ,

where H - P° is the energy operator. If P were antiunitary and antilinear
then it would anticommute with i, so PHP-l = -H. But then for and
state T of energy E > 0, there would have to be another state P-1 T of

energy - E < 0. There are no states of negative energy (energy less than
that of the vacuum), so we are forced to choose the other alternative- P
is linear and unitary, and commutes rather than anticommutes with H .

On the other hand, setting p =Din Eq. (2.6.6) yields

T i HT-1 _ ----i H .

If we supposed that T is linear and unitary then we could simply cancel
the is, and find TAT-1 = - H, with the again disastrous conclusion that
for any state T of energy E there is another state T-1'I' of energy -E.
To avoid this, we are forced here to conclude that T is antilinear and
antxuraitary.
Now that we have decided that P is linear and T is antilinear, we
(2.6.3)-(2.6.6) in terms of the generators
can conveniently rewrite Eqs.
(2.4.15)-(2.4.17) in a three-dimensional notation

PIMP-1 = -K (2.6.8)
PPP-1 = _P, (2.6.9)

TKTT' _ +K , (2.6. 1 1)
TPT-1 = -P , (2.6.12)

and, as shown before,

PHP-1 = THT-1 = H . (2.6.13)
It is physically sensible that P should preserve the sign of J, because at
least the orbital part is a vector product r x p of two vectors, both of which
change sign under an inversion of the spatial coordinate system. On the
other hand, T reverses J, because after time-reversal an observer will see
all bodies spinning in the opposite direction. Note by the way that Eq .
(2.6.10) is consistent with the angular-momentum commutation relations
J x J = iJ, because T reverses not only J, but also i. The reader can easily
(2.6.7)-(2.6.13) are consistent with all the commutation
check that Eqs.
relations (2.4.1$)-(2.4.24).
P :M> O
The one-particle states 'I'k,, are defined as eigenvectors of P . H, and J3
with eigenvalues 0, M, and a, respectively. From Eqs. (2.6.7), (2.6.9), and
(2.6.13), we see that the same must be true of the state P`F'k, ,, and therefore
(barring degeneracies) these states can only differ by a phase

Let us now consider what P and T do to one-particle states :

with a phase factor (I~ j = 1) that may or may not depend on the spin a.
