Abstract

We study an extension of general relativity with a second metric and an ex-
change symmetry between the two metrics. Such an extension might help to address
some of the outstanding problems with general relativity, for example the smallness
of the cosmological constant. We here derive a family of exact solutions for this
theory. In this two-parameter family of solutions the gravitational ﬁeld is sourced
by a time-independent massless scalar ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that the only limit in which
the scalar ﬁeld entirely vanishes is ﬂat space. The regular Schwarzschild-solution
is left with a scalar ﬁeld hidden in the second metric’s sector.

1 Introduction

General relativity, now more than a century old, still holds numerous mysteries: The cos-
mological concordance model, ΛCDM – where Λ stands for the cosmological constant
and CDM for cold dark matter – requires the introduction of dark matter and dark energy
whose microscopic origin is unknown. Worse, it is still unclear how information can be
recovered from black holes, signaling a severe shortcoming in our understanding of the
theory’s semi-classical limit. And worst, we still do not know the right way to combine
general relativity with quantum ﬁeld theory.

The cosmological constant in particular is hard to make sense of as vacuum energy,
and even the most popular approaches to quantum gravity fail to explain not only its
value, but how a value as small as measured can be stabilized without undue ﬁnetuning.
Indeed, it has recently been argued that even if we would manage to explain the value of
the cosmological constant itself, the expected ﬂuctuations around the mean value would
still be problematic [1].

In the hope to address some of these shortcomings, many attempts have been made to
extend general relativity by additional ﬁelds. The maybe most obvious modiﬁcation is to
add a second metric, because such an extension can be expected to make itself noticable
primarily in the gravitational sector where its effects would be desirable. These so-called
‘bi-metric’ theories [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] were long thought to be unstable, but it has recently

Symmetric Gravity

been shown that in a fully covariant treatment, bi-metric theories can be free of ghosts
and consistently stable [6, 7]. In these extensions of general relativity, gravitons can be
massive.

Bi-metric theories however leave one with a lot more freedom than general relativity
because there are four different terms through which the two metrics can be coupled,
and each of these terms introduces a new parameter. This additional freedom opens the
possibility to ﬁt cosmological data better than ΛCDM [8], but the price to pay is that the
additional parameter make the theory arbitrary and unappealing.

This raises the question if not there are symmetry requirements which can be used to
single out particularly natural bi-metric models, and indeed there are. The simplest bi-
metric model is one in which an exchange of the two metrics does not alter the physics,
gravitons remain massless, and direct coupling terms between the two metrics are absent
[9]. For the sake of brevity, this particular bi-metric extension with exchange symmetry
will hereafter be referred to as ‘symmetric gravity.’ If the symmetry is unbroken, sym-
metric gravity has the same number of free parameters as general relativity, ie two: the
gravitational coupling constant (Newton’s constant) and the cosmological constant.

Bi-metric theories generically violate the equivalence principle because particles now
have two different ways of coupling to gravity. As previously demonstrated in [9], sym-
metric gravity in particular allows gravitational charges to become negative.
Inertial
masses always remain positive, but the ratio of inertial to gravitational mass can now be
either plus or minus one. In the generalization from masses to the stress-energy-tensors,
the introduction of negative gravitational charges becomes possible without inducing vac-
uum instability because the source to the gravitational ﬁeld is no longer identical to the
Noether current; instead, both are only identical up to a sign. Similar symmetries had
previously been studied [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], but the issue of
covariance was only fully resolved in the bi-metric formulation of [9].

Symmetric gravity provides a solution to the problem of technical naturalness of the
cosmological constant. This is because the symmetry between positively and negatively
gravitating ﬁelds cancels gravitational contributions to the vacuum energy to exactly zero.
According to current measurements, the cosmological constant is, of course, not zero.
But if the symmetry between the two matter sectors was weakly broken, the smallness of
the cosmological constant would still be technically natural. So far we have not derived
a speciﬁc mechanism for how to break the symmetry. However, symmetric gravity is to
date the only known symmetry which can protect the cosmological constant and which
is not already know to be strongly broken.

However, little is known about symmetric gravity and its compatibility with obser-
vation. The theory contains general relativity as a special case when the sectors of the
two metrics decouple, and so we know that the solutions of general relativity can be re-
covered. But recovering what we already know wasn’t why we added the second metric.
Instead, we are interested to ﬁnd out what happens if both sectors interact with each other
and whether that can explain some of our observations better than general relativity.

Symmetric Gravity

Unfortunately, even situations with homogeneous and spherically symmetric matter
distributions display unintuitive properties and the equations become difﬁcult to solve.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate one of the simplest cases: static, spherically
symmetric scalar ﬁelds coupled to the two metrics. This investigation will turn out to be
instructive and also prepares future work on collapse scenarios.

Throughout this paper we use the convention c = ~ = 1. The signature of both
metrics is (−1, 1, 1, 1). Small Greek indices are space-time indices and run from 0 to 3.

2 Symmetric Gravity

We will here brieﬂy summarize how one obtains the ﬁeld equations of symmetric gravity.
The full treatment can be found in [9].

The starting point is that we use two different metrics, g and h, each with its own
coordinate system. The two sets of coordinates will be denoted with small Greek indices,
one with and one without underlines. Once the equations are derived, one may chose
the coordinate systems to be identical. However, the relation between the two systems
contains gauge degrees of freedom which are necessary in the formulation of the action,
otherwise the exchange symmetry cannot be made explicit. The relevance of this will
become clear in the next section, when we construct a concrete solution.

For each of the metrics we can deﬁne a Levi-Cevita connection that is torsion-free
and metric-compatible. This gives rise to two different connections that will be marked
with a preceding index to tell them apart, ie (g)∇ is the connection compatible with g
and (h)∇ is the connection compatible with h. To each of the metrics we can then derive
a curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, and curvature scalar, which will be denoted (g)Rα
νκǫ,
(h)Rα

νκǫ, and so on.

Next, we deﬁne the pull-over, τ , as the map between the two sectors that converts the

derivatives into each other, ie

τ ν
ν

(h)∇ντ α
α τ

γ

β
β τ

γ ...Aαβγ... = (g)∇νAαβγ...

,

and similarly for contravariant indices. We use the ﬁrst index of τ for contraction with
g and the second index for contraction with h. The map τ must be invertible, and so we
deﬁne the inverse as

τ κ

ντ ν

ν = δκ
ν

,

τ ν
ν τ ν

κ = δν

κ

.

We will denote the determinant of gκν with g and the determinant of hκν with h.

Since (1) has to hold in particular for the metrics themselves, this implies

(1)

(2)

(3)

We have here introduced a normalization factor N , since it is not generally possible to
set N = 1 if one ﬁxes the asymptotic values of both g and h.

gνκ = N 2τ ν

ν τ κ

κ hνκ

.

3

S. Hossenfelder

Symmetric Gravity

In addition to using the pull-overs, we can also just convert the indices from one
basis into another, from which one obtains the coordinate expressions hνκ and gνκ. We
therefore extend the deﬁnition of the pull-over in the obvious way to

gνκ = N 2τ α

ν τ ǫ

κ hαǫ , gνκ = N 2τ α

ν τ ǫ

κ hαǫ

.

In the following we assume that the pull-over is not a dynamical ﬁeld and that the

variation

δτ νκ = 0 .

This does not mean that the ﬁeld is constant – this would break general covariance. It
just means that we do not add extra terms to the action that generate dynamical equations
for the pull-over. In principle we could add both kinetic terms and a potential, but such
a complication is not necessary for the following. For the purposes of this paper, one
can think of the constraint (5) as being the condition in which the ﬁeld sits in a potential
minimum.

Finally, we assume that we have matter which consists of two sectors, identical except
for their respective coupling to gravity. We will in the following focus on massless scalar
ﬁelds, which we will denote φ and φ. The ﬁeld φ is a normally gravitating ﬁeld and the
ﬁeld φ is the ﬁeld whose behavior is determined by the second metric. Of course this
nomenclature is somewhat arbitrary since the two sectors obey the same equations. We
simply refer to the one we have observed so far as ‘normal’ and chose to assign it the
metric g. Let us emphasize here that φ is not conjugated to φ, and the second sector does
not describe anti-matter.

The action then takes the form

where G is Newton’s constant.

Two properties of this action are worth drawing attention to. First, the two metrics do
not couple directly, they interact merely via the matter ﬁelds. Second, the kinetic terms
of all ﬁelds are positive. Variation of this metric leads to the equations

With the sign convention adopted here the stress-energy-tensors (9) and (10) correspond
to the generalization of the inertial masses, so that −T 0

as usual. The change of sign in the coupling between the two types of ﬁelds comes in
through the requirement (5); for details please refer to [9].

0 = ρ ≥ 0 and −T 0

In addition to the ﬁeld equations, we have the Bianchi-identities, which enforce the

compatibility of the pull-over with the covariant derivatives:

κ T νκ! = 0 .

(11)

Since the determinants of g and h transform identically, it is g/h = g/h. We have only
added the underlines in Eqs (8,11) to make the symmetry more apparent.

Inspecting the ﬁeld equations (7,8) shows quickly that vacuum solutions bring in an
ambiguity because then the two metrics entirely decouple and the constraints (11) do
not constrain anything. For this reason it is a priori entirely unclear what would be the
correct symmetric extension of, for example, the Schwarzschild metric. To ﬁnd out, one
should look at a collapse scenario because the presence of matter during collapse would
tie together the two metrics, and one could then compare the endstates. Exact collapse
solutions however are difﬁcult to ﬁnd. The next best thing we can do is to look at a family
of static solutions that reduces to the vacuum case with some parameter, which we will
do in the next section.

3 Solving the Field Equations

We here want to derive solutions for symmetric gravity sourced by a negatively gravitat-
ing ﬁeld φ, and so we set φ = 0. This means we have to solve the equations

and the scalar ﬁeld fulﬁlls the wave-equation in the h-background:

∂νp−hhνκ∂κφ = 0 .

The most general case would be a combination of non-vanishing φ and φ, but this
generalization will turn out to be trivial once we know the case with a purely negative
source. We will come back to this in the discussion.
We start with the ansatz for spherical symmetry

ds2

g = −α(r)2dt2 + a(r)2dr2 + Ω2
h = −β(r)2dt2 + b(r)2dr2 + Ω2

h(r)r2dΩ2 ,

with the angular element

dΩ2 = dθ2 + sin(θ)2dϕ2 ,

(15)

(16)
(17)

(18)

where we have assumed that the angular coordinates are identical in both metrics. We
have also assumed that the time-coordinates are identical. Since the metric is static, this
can always be achieved by a rescaling without affecting the equations.

The main difﬁculty in solving the coupled set of ﬁeld equations is that the second
coordinate system means that we have differential equations with respect to both sets
of coordinates. One would clearly prefer to use the same coordinates for both metrics.
But then it is no longer possible to gauge both metrics independently from each other,
which increases the number of functions we have to solve for. Either way, thus, we face
complications.

Just to give a concrete example. We could choose an isotropic gauge for both g and h,
then hope that the coordinates are identical and start with this ansatz (we would ﬁnd that
the equations cannot all be fulﬁlled). Or we could chose a gauge in which Ω2
h = 1
and then hope that the coordinates are identical (this doesn’t work either). These choices
are both different (and both wrong) because the transformations between gauges are not
generally the same for both metrics: If we take the isotropic system for g and transform
it to the coordinates with Ω2
g = 1, this will not also bring h into the coordinates with
Ω2

g = Ω2

Consequently, if we want to use the same coordinate system for both metrics, we have
to make a very educated guess which coordinates allow the same gauge for both sectors.
Fortunately, for the static scalar case it is not so difﬁcult to guess the right coordinate
system because the wave-equation for the ﬁeld takes on the particularly simple form

h = 1.

∂r(cid:16)p−hhrr∂rφ(cid:17) = 0 .

(19)

Now we note that if this ﬁeld also fulﬁlls the wave-equation in the g-background, this
will solve the constraint from the Bianchi-identities identically, which means that the
match between the coordinate systems must be correct.

6

S. Hossenfelder

Symmetric Gravity

From this we infer that a good gauge is

√−ggrr = √

−hhrr = r2 sin(θ) ,

so that

∂r(cid:0)√−ggrr∂rφ(cid:1) = 0 ⇔ ∂r(cid:16)√−hhrr∂rφ(cid:17) = 0 .

Note that we have dropped here the underlines on the second coordinate system because
we have now assumed that this gauge is possible for both metrics in the same coordinate
system.

This gauge leads to the requirements

Ωg = a(r)/α(r) , Ωh = b(r)/β(r) ,

and the solution for scalar ﬁeld is

With this ansatz one can then derive the ﬁeld equations and despair over them for
some while. Alternatively, one uses the static scalar ﬁeld solution originally derived by
Janis, Newman and Winicour [21] and later rediscovered [22] by Wyman [23]. Hereafter
referred to as JNWW, this solution has the line-element

ds2 = −γ(ρ)ndt2 + γ(ρ)−ndρ2 + γ(ρ)1−nρ2dΩ2 ,

We know that the JNWW solution must be a solution to the ﬁeld equations for the

our coordinates with the gauge requirement that √hhrr = r2 sin θ. This gives rise to the

This solves the equations (13) and (15), and it remains to solve equation (12). One
can do this either by working through the ﬁeld equations, or by giving the solution (29) a
hard look, which reveals that the substitution n → in, M → iM gives back a real valued
metric with the signature of the metric ﬂipped. By absorbing this sign into the source,
we make the ansatz

a(r) = eM n/r , α(r) = Ωg(r) =

Now, while the (t, r) coordinate system has been convenient for deriving the metric,
it is arguably awkward since grr has an inﬁnite number of poles. Inspection of the Weyl-
tensor square however shows no pathologies, indicating that we are merely looking at
coordinate singularities.
Indeed, we can remove the singularities for example by the

5 Discussion

The ﬁrst thing one notes about the solution (39) is that it has no horizon. This is not
surprising since the ‘normally’ gravitating matter, whose behavior is determined by this
metric, should be repelled by the negatively gravitating scalar ﬁeld. Hence, there is no
way for it to become trapped. Such behavior is a consequence merely of gravity being
mediated by a spin-2 ﬁeld, which has the effect that like charge attract and unlike charges
repel (exactly reversed to the case of a spin-1 ﬁeld).

Next we note that in the limit n → 1, the h-metric reduces to the Schwarzschild-
solution. But, interestingly, the g-metric does not also reduce to a vacuum-solution in the
same limit. The reason is that the normalization-factor N in the pull-over goes to zero at
the same rate as the pulled-over source to the g-metric.
Now, since our analysis is entirely symmetric between the two sectors, we can draw
from this a conclusion about normal black holes (ie sourced by positive mass). For this,
we swap the negatively gravitating ﬁeld for a positively gravitating one, and the g-metric
with the h-metric. We then notice that, while the Schwarzschild black hole is a unique
solution for what the g-metric is concerned, it can remain accompanied by a scalar ﬁeld

in the h-sector. This difference is not noticeable for any ‘normal’ ﬁelds that couple only
to the g-metric and hence makes no difference for existing observations.

Clearly the fact that this is a scalar ﬁeld and not some other ﬁeld comes from the
starting point of our analysis, so one is lead to speculate that a similar thing might hap-
pen with other ﬁelds. This would mean that while the endstate of black hole collapse of
normal matter is unique and ‘hair-less’ for the g-metric, it is not unique for the corre-
sponding h-metric. (And vice versa, a collapse of negative matter would not result in a
unique endstate for the g-metric.)

In the chosen coordinate system by assumption both the φ and φ-ﬁelds have the same
coordinate-expression, and so, combining sources with contributions from both does not
give rise to a new pair of metrics. One just has to make sure that the parameter M that
appears in the solutions is suitably composed of the contributions from both ﬁelds, rather
than from one alone.

6 Conclusion

We have derived here a pair of metrics that is self-consistently sourced by massless scalar
ﬁeld, coupled positively to the one metric, and negatively to the other one. The solution
shows that in a bi-metric framework the Schwarzschild-solution is not the unique endstate
of collapsing matter.
