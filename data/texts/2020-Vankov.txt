Abstract

The year 1915 of publishing Einstein’s original paper “Explanation
of the Perihelion Motion of Mercury from General Relativity Theory”
marks the origin of General Relativity. The perihelion advance of
Mercury’s orbit was obtained from Astronomical observations by Le
Verrier (1859), late Newcomb (1882). Their evaluation of the eﬀect
was about 43 arcsec/cen, which coincides with Einstein’s prediction
half a Century later derived from his “ﬁeld equations”. Einstein’s
original paper and the corresponding Schwarzschild’s letters were pub-
lished in German. We present their translations of high ﬁdelity and
physical accuracy specially made by Professor Roger Rydin from the
University of Virginia. The translations are followed with our criti-
cal analysis of Einstein’s “approximate” derivation of the Mercury’s
perihelion advance from his ﬁeld equations. There is a common be-
lief among Physical Community that Einstein’s prediction is correctly
derived, its physical meaning is fully understood, and the value of
the GR perihelion advance is conﬁrmed in observations to the high
precision, not less than 1 percent. However, from our analysis it fol-
lows that every item of the belief is a myth, and Einstein’s prediction
is plainly ﬂawed. Schwarzschild expressed a strong objection to Ein-
stein’s teary complete mess in derivation from “ﬁeld equations”. He
righteously suggested to derive the eﬀect from his “exact solution”, the
metric quadratic form, which should be called “Schwarzschild metric”.
But it is drastically diﬀerent from what is known as “Schwarzschild
metric”. He purposely derived the metric having no “coordinate” or
“central” inﬁnities by introducing “the cut-oﬀ parameter”, in other
words, he made the GR Dynamics “renormalizable”. After his pre-
mature death, somebody did not like it. So, the metric in his name

was quietly reshaped and acquired the present singularity form. This
made hundreds of GR following apprentices and “experts” to work
hard and useless on the GR problem of “non-renormalizability” and
“non-quatizability”. Unfortunately, Schwarzschild’s derivation of the
eﬀect did not make a diﬀerence. A reader can get his own mind on the
issues after having been familiarized with historically valuable papers
presented here. Maybe, a curiosity awakens about the GR quicksand
foundation, the so-called Einstein’s Field Equations, which the whole
GR theory is rested upon.

Key words: Einstein, Schwarzschild, General Relativity, Mercury

perihelion, ﬁeld equations.

According to general theory of relativity, the elliptical orbit of a planet re-
ferred to a Newtonian frame of reference rotates in its own plane in the same
direction as the planet moves... The observations cannot be made in a Newto-
nian frame of reference. They are aﬀected by the precession of the equinoxes,
and the determination of the precessional motion is one of the most diﬃcult
problems of observational astronomy. It is not surprising that a diﬀerence
of opinions could exist regarding the closeness of agreement of observed and
theoretical motions... I am not aware that relativity is at present regarded by
physicists as a theory that may be believed or not, at will. Nevertheless, it
may be of some interest to present the most recent evidence on the degree of
agreement between the observed and theoretical motions of the planets.

Explanation of the Perihelion Motion of Mercury from General

Relativity Theory

Albert Einstein

Introduction
In an earlier version of the work appearing in this journal, I have presented
the ﬁeld equations of gravity, which are covariant under corresponding trans-
formations having a determinant equals unity. In an Addendum to this work,
I have shown that each of the ﬁeld equations is generally covariant when the
scalar of the energy tensor of the matter vanishes, and I have thereby shown
from the introduction of this hypothesis, through which time and space are
robbed of the last vestige of objective reality, that in principle there are no
doubts standing against this assertion. 1

In this work, I found an important conﬁrmation of this radical Relativity
theory; it exhibits itself namely in the secular turning of Mercury in the

1In a soon to follow manuscript, it will be shown that such a hypothesis is unnecessary.
It is only important that one such choice of coordinate system is possible, in which the
determinant |gµν| takes the value −1. The following investigation is then independent
thereof.

course of its orbital motion, as was discovered by Le Verrier. Namely, the
approximately 45(cid:48)(cid:48) per century amount is qualitatively and quantitatively
explained without the special hypotheses that he had to assume. 2

Furthermore, it shows that this theory has a stronger (doubly strong)
light bending eﬀect in consequence through the gravitational ﬁeld than it
amounted to in my earlier investigation.

The Gravitational Field
As my last two papers have shown, the gravitational ﬁeld in a vacuum

for a suitably chosen system of coordinates has to satisfy the following

that the scalar of the energy tensor of the ”material“ always vanishes, so that

|gµν| = −1

We place a point mass (the Sun) at the origin of the coordinate system.
The gravitational ﬁeld, which this mass point produces, can be calculated
from these equations through successive approximations.

In this regard, one may think that the gµν for the given solar mass is not

it that these equations with the necessary transformation with the determi-
nant equal to unity are covariant. It should be correct in this case to consider
that all these solutions through such transformations can be reduced to one
another, that they themselves are also (by given boundary conditions) only
formally but not physically distinguishable from one another. These over-
lying considerations allow me to obtain a solution without considering the
question whether or not it is the only unique possibility.

2E. Freundlich wrote in an earlier contribution about the impossibility that the anomaly
of the motion of Mercury is satisﬁed on the basis of Newtonian theory, (Astr. Nachr. 4803,
Vol. 201, June 1915).

Or more compactly

gρσ = −δρσ;

gρ4 = g4ρ = 0;

(4a)

Hereby, ρ and σ are the indices 1, 2, 3: the δρσ is the Kronecker delta symbol
equal to 1 or 0, that is when either ρ = σ or ρ (cid:54)= σ.

We now set forward the following, that the gµν diﬀer from the values given
in (4a) by an amount that is small compared to unity. This deviation we
handle as a small magnitude change of ”ﬁrst order“, and functions of n-th
degree of this deviation as of “n-th order“. Equations (1) and (3) are set
in the condition of (4a), for calculation through successive approximations
of the gravitational ﬁeld up to the magnitude n-th order of accuracy. We
speak in this sense of the ”n-th approximation“; the equations (4a) are the
”zero-th approximation“.

The following given solutions have the following coordinate system-tied

properties:

1. All components are independent of x4.
2. The solution is (spatially) symmetric about the origin of the coordinate
system, in the sense that one obtains the same solution if one makes a linear
orthogonal (spatial) transformation.

3. The equations gρ4 = g4ρ = 0 are valid exactly (for ρ = 1, 2, 3).
4. The gµν possess at inﬁnity the values given in (4a).

First Approximation
It is easy to verify, that ﬁrst order accuracy of the equations (1) and (3)
as well as the above named 4 conditions is satisﬁed through the substitution
of

The gρ4 as well as g4ρ are thereby set through condition 3; the r means the
magnitude of r =

(cid:33)

That condition 3 in the sense of ﬁrst order is fulﬁlled, one sees at once. In a
simple way to visualize that ﬁeld equation (1) in the ﬁrst order approximation
is also fulﬁlled, one needs only to observe that the neglect of magnitudes of
second and higher orders on the left side of equation (1) can be realized
successively through the substitution

whereby α only runs from 1 to 3.

As one sees from (4b), our theory brings with it that in the case of a
slowly moving mass the components g11 to g33 already appear to the non-zero
magnitude of ﬁrst order. We will see later that hereby there is no diﬀerence
between Newton’s law (in the ﬁrst order approximation). However, it gives
a somewhat diﬀerent inﬂuence of the gravitational ﬁeld on the light ray as in
my previous work; as the light velocity is introduced through the equation

gµνdxµdxν = 0

(5)

which the Hypothesis (cid:80) T µ

By use of the Huygen’s principle, one ﬁnds from (5) and (4b) through a
simple calculation, that a light ray from the Sun at distance ∆ undergoes
an angular deﬂection of magnitude 2α/∆, while the earlier calculation, by
µ = 0 was not involved, had given the value α/∆.
A corresponding light ray from the surface rim of the Sun should give a de-
viation of 1.7(cid:48)(cid:48) (instead of 0.85(cid:48)(cid:48)). Herein there is no shift of the spectral lines
through the gravitational potential, for which Mr. Freundlich has measured
the magnitude against the ﬁxed stars, and independently determined that
this only depends on g44.

After we have taken gµν in the ﬁrst order approximation, we can also

index 4 appears once or three times, vanish.

Second Approximation
It will be shown here that we only need the three components Γσ

44 accurate
in the magnitude of second order to be able to evaluate the planetary orbit
with suﬃcient accuracy. For this, it is enough to use the last ﬁeld equation
together with the general conditions, which have led to our general solution.

From this equation, it follows that the Newton motion equation is obtained
as a ﬁrst approximation. Namely, when the speed of a point particle is small
with respect to the speed of light, so dx1 , dx2 , dx3 are small against dx4. It
follows that we come to the ﬁrst approximation, in which we take on the right
side always the condition σ = τ = 4. One obtains then with consideration of

Then the ﬁrst three equations are accurately Newtonian. This leads one to
the planar orbit equations in polar coordinates r, φ, and so leads to the
known energy and the Law of Area equations

where A and B are constants of the energy- as well as Law of Areas, whereby
the shortened form is inserted.

which together with (9) determines the motion of the point mass. Besides, it
should be remarked that (7b) and (9) for the case of an orbital motion give
no deviation from Kepler’s third law.

From (7b) next follows the exactly valid form of the equation

(10)

where B means a constant. The Law of Areas is also accurate in the mag-
nitude of second order, when one uses the ”period“ of the planet for the
time measurement. To now obtain the secular advance of the orbital ellipse
from (7b), one inserts the members of ﬁrst order in the brackets of the right
side arranging it to best advantage using (10), and in the ﬁrst term of the
equations (8), through which operation the members of second order on the
right side are not changed. Through this, the brackets take the form

Finally, one chooses s

1 − 2A as the second variable, and again calls it

s, so that one has a slightly changed meaning of the constant B:

For an entire passage, the perihelion moves by

in the directional sense of the orbital motion, when we designate by a the
major half axis, and by e the eccentricity. This leads one to the period T (in
seconds), so one obtains with c as light velocity in cm/sec:

This calculation leads to the planet Mercury to move its perihelion for-
ward by 43 (cid:48)(cid:48) per century, while the astronomers give 45 (cid:48)(cid:48)±5(cid:48)(cid:48), an exceptional
diﬀerence between observation and Newtonian theory. This has great signif-
icance as full agreement.

For Earth and Mars the astronomers give a forward movement of 11(cid:48)(cid:48) and
9(cid:48)(cid:48) respectively per century, while our formula gives only 4(cid:48)(cid:48) and 1(cid:48)(cid:48), respec-
tively. It appears however from these results, considering the small eccentric-
ity of the orbits of each planet, a smaller eﬀect is appropriate. Conﬁrmation
for the correctness of these values for the movement of the perihelion is the
product with the eccentricity (e dπ

dt ).

One considers for these the magnitudes of the Newcomb given values,
which I thank Dr. Freundlich for supplying, so one gains the impression that
only the forward movement of the perihelion of Mercury will ever be truly
proven. I will however gladly allow professional astronomers a ﬁnal say.

2 Schwarzschild’s letter to Einstein

Letter from K Schwarzschild to A Einstein dated 22 December

1915

The letter is presented in English owing to Professor Roger A. Rydin

Honored Mr. Einstein,
In order to be able to verify your gravitational theory, I have brought
myself nearer to your work on the perihelion of Mercury, and occupied myself
with the problem solved with the First Approximation. Thereby, I found
myself in a state of great confusion. I found for the ﬁrst approximation of
the coeﬃcient gµν other than your solution the following two:

(cid:32) β

(cid:33)

gρσ = −βxρxσ

r5 + δρσ

3r3

;

g44 = 1

As follows, it had beside your α yet a second term, and the problem was
physically undetermined. From this I made at once by good luck a search
for a full solution. A not too diﬃcult calculation gave the following result:
It gave only a line element, which fulﬁlls your conditions 1) to 4), as well as
ﬁeld- and determinant equations, and at the null point and only in the null
point is singular.

If:

x1 = r cos φ cos θ, x2 = r sin φ cos θ, x3 = r sin θ

R = (r3 + α3)1/3 = r

1 +

(cid:32)

(cid:33)
α3
r3 + ...

then the line element becomes:

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
1 − γ
R

(cid:16)

dt2 − dR2
1 − γ

R

ds2 =

(cid:17) − R2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2)

R, θ, φ are not “allowed” coordinates, with which one must build the ﬁeld
equations, because they do not have the determinant = 1, however the line
element expresses itself as the best.

The equation of the orbit remains exactly as you obtained in the ﬁrst
approximation (11), only one must understand for x not 1/r, but 1/R, which

13

is a diﬀerence of the order of 10−12, so it has practically the same absolute
validity.

The diﬃculty with the two arbitrary constants α and β, which the First
Approximation gave, resolves itself thereby, that β must have a determined
value of the order of α4 , so as α is given, so will the solution be divergent
by continuation of the approximation.

It is after all the clear meaning of your problem in the best order.
It is an entirely wonderful thing, that from one so abstract an idea comes

out such a conclusive clariﬁcation of the Mercury anomaly.

As you see, it means that the friendly war with me, in which in spite of
your considerable protective ﬁre throughout the terrestrial distance, allows
this stroll in your fantasy land.

2.1 Comments

2.1.1 Historical Docs

Einstein’s paper devoted to the GR prediction of Mercury’s perihelion ad-
vance, Doc.24 (see Notes), is the only one among his publications that con-
tains the explanation of the GR eﬀect.
In his following paper The Foun-
dations of the General Theory of Relativity, 1916, Doc.30, Einstein presents
his new (he called it “correct”) calculation of the bending of light while the
Mercury perihelion is only mentioned by referring it as in Doc.24, along with
Schwarzshild’s work on “the exact solution”.

Meanwhile, numerous works have been published and continue to appear
in press with suggestions of “clariﬁcation”, “improvement”, “radical change”
or “refutation” of Einstein’s 1915 prediction of the perihelion advance and
bending of light. Most of them, in our view, are results of either confusion or
lack of qualiﬁcation. Qualiﬁed works presenting a fresh view of the problem,
or related new ideas or concepts are discussed in [V an10] (see Notes). Among
them, there is a monograph on General Relativity by Bergmann (1942) with
Foreword by A. Einstein who clearly acknowledged his own advisory and
authorization role in the book composition. Strangely enough, the fact that
given there derivations of the GR predictions are quite diﬀerent from those
in Doc.24, is not paid much attention in the literature. In spite of method-
ological diﬀerences, claimed predictions in the above works, however, remain
the same.

As a matter of fact, the GR foundational premises have been subjected
to changes and reinterpretations (optional, alternative, or claimed “correct”
ones) by Einstein himself, his advocates as well as today’s GR specialists and
self-proclaimed “experts”. Among the key issues, the problems of energy and
angular momentum conservation along with the properties of stress-energy-
momentum tensor remain the “hot” (better say, controversial) ones. Possibly,
this is one of the reasons why there are numerous publications devoted to
the GR perihelion advance eﬀect and the light bending, which are considered
controversial or arguable.

2.1.2 Einstein and Schwarzschild “in a friendly war”

One may be critical of Einstein’s work (Doc.24) in many respects, some
arguable issues are worth noting here.

1. The diﬀerence from Newton’s physics is an appearance of the GR term

15

in the equation of motion (11), not to speak about diﬀerentials with respect
to the proper time τ . In operational terms, the proper time is recorded by
a clock attached to the test particle moving along the world line s so that
components dxµ/ds = uµ deﬁne a tangential 4-velocity unit vector. In SR, it
relates to the proper 4-momentum vector P µ = muµ. In Doc.24, however, the
proper time is actually interpreted similarly to the coordinate (“far-away”)
time t = γτ , which deﬁnes three components of velocity vi = dxi/dt (i =
1, 2, 3). Thus, the Lorentz factor in the relativistic kinetic energy becomes
lost.

√

2. The equation of motion (11) (the objective of the work) is obtained
1 − 2A where
at the expense of an arbitrary replacement of s = cτ with s
1 − 2A from unity has a magnitude of the order
a diﬀerence of the factor
α/r0. The corresponding impact on the solution is of the order of the eﬀect
in question. At the same time, the GR conservation laws for total energy
and angular momentum become controversial: with τ replaced with t, both
laws formally appear in the Newtonian form.

√

3. Unlike in the paper (Doc.24), in Bergman’s book the GR term becomes
responsible for both the perihelion advance and the bending of light; conse-
quently, the derivations of both eﬀects principally changed, ﬁrst of all, the
Schwarzschild metric was acknowledged as the theoretical basis for the GR
eﬀects evaluation. It should be noted that, while the methodology changed,
the angular momentum (“area”) law remained unaﬀected by the GR term.
One can argue, however, that the GR perihelion advance eﬀect necessarily
requires a relativistic generalization of the classical conservation laws.

The immediate response to Einstein’s work (Doc.24) came from Karl
Schwarzschild. His famous work “On the Gravitational Field of a Point-Mass,
According to Einstein’s Theory”, Sitzungsberichte der K¨oniglich Preußischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften, 189-196, 1916) was published less than a
month after Einstein’s work. It should be noted that Schwarzschild derived
“the exact solution” in the form to be consistent with the Einstein’s “four
conditions”.
It has no central divergence and cannot be mixed up with
the commonly known “Schwarzschild metric”. The less known fact is that
Schwarzschild, before the publication, wrote a letter to Einstein in which he
criticized Einstein for mistakes in “the successive approximation approach”,
as is seen from the above translated Letter from K Schwarzschild to A. Ein-
stein dated 22 December 1915, in ColP ap, vol. 8a, Doc.169.

Schwarzschild claims that his solution reproduces Einstein’s prediction of

16

the GR perihelion advance. But it does not, – because the concept of energy
is gone, and coeﬃcients of the equation have very diﬀerent meaning there.
Let us see it in more details.

Schwarzschild’s original “exact unique solution” to Einstein’s ﬁeld equa-
tions in vacuum for a point source is the squared 4-world line element, which
in the polar coordinates is given by

where

R = (r3 + α3)1/3

The α is the so-called Schwarzschild’s radius equal to the doubled gravita-
tional radius rg, that is, α = 2rg = 2GM/c2
0;

the r is the coordinate radial distance, not strictly determined but used

as a measure of distance from the source.

the t is the coordinate (“far-away”) time.
the R is the approximation of r to the precision of α3 in the original

Schwarzschild’s metric.

At some historical moment, the Schwarzschild metric in literature ac-
quired the form, in which the R was replaced with the r, so that the met-
ric became divergent. The original metric, as mentioned, does not diverge:
R → α as r → 0. This means that, strictly speaking, “the black hole”
concept does not come out from the General Relativity theory (see Stephen
J. Crothers on the Internet and elsewhere). As is known, Einstein him-
self resisted the BH idea. He also understood, when speculating about the
gravitational radiation (particularly, from a BH neighborhood), that a linear
perturbative approximation to the metric does not provide it. As concerns
the perihelion advance, Einstein seemed to be quite reluctant to appreciate
“the exact solution” and the way how Schwarzschild treated it, in spite of
the fact that the Schwarzschild metric respects all four Einstein’s conditions.
Schwarzschild traditionally starts with the three standard integrals of

The integral (2.3) coincides with Einstein’s expression for the angular
momentum. However, (2.4) is not the energy: according to Schwarzschild,
it is “the deﬁnition of the unit of time”. This is in the spirit of the General
Relativity Theory, in which the energy is not locally deﬁned. Consequently,
the constant (2.2) denoted h must be h = 1 by construction.

After that, the equation of motion for x = 1/R takes the form

where the ﬁrst term on the right sight is zero (compare it with Einstein’s
equation (11)).

3 Critique

We are going to follow Einstein’s solution step-by-step. Unfortunately, Ein-
stein wrote the paper (Doc.25) very schematic, so that one needs to restore
his line of thoughts and, at the same time, correct mistakes (see Notes).

The exact solution to (11) is given by:

(cid:90) x2

x1

(cid:113)

φ =

dx

α(x − x1)(x − x2)(x − x3)

(3.1)

Here we denote x1 = 1/r1, x2 = 1/r2, x3 = 1/r3 (instead of denotations
α1 = 1/r1, α2 = 1/r2, α3 = 1/r3 in Doc.24), which are real roots of the
homogeneous cubic equation of the bounded motion problem (11). Let the
third root x3 be due to the GR term. The integral cannot be calculated
analytically (though it can be expressed in terms of elliptic functions). Ein-
stein’s obvious idea is to compare (3.1) with the analogous solution in the
classical (Newtonian) formulation of the problem, the GR “small” term being
considered a perturbation source.

Einstein’s approach to (3.1) is to eliminate x3 using an exact relationship

between the three roots:

(x1 + x2 + x3) =

1
α

(3.2)

18

Recall, the α = 2rg where rg is the gravitational radius. He begins with
the approximation to (3.2) by putting x3 = 1/α with the following algebraic
approximation to (3.1) (to the precision of order α2) allowing one to split the
integrand into two additive parts: I(x) = I1(x) + I2(x), where I1 is the main
part from the classical solution, and I2 is the part due to a perturbation of
the classical solution by the GR term:

(cid:113)−α(x − x1)(x − x2)(x3 − x)

≈

(cid:113)−(x − x1)(x − x2)

+

α(x1 + x2 + x)

(cid:113)−(x − x1)(x − x2)

2

(3.3)

As wished, (3.3) does not have the root x3 and is easily integrated analyti-
cally.

The ﬁnal crucial step to the GR solution must be an evaluation of the
impact of the GR term on the roots from the GR solution in comparison
with the corresponding classical roots ˜x1, ˜x2 describing a “nearly circular”
orbit when ˜x1 + ˜x2 = 2/˜r0. The radius ˜r0 is the one of the classical circle to
be compared with the corresponding r0 from the GR exact solution. In the
zero-th approximation, it is assumed that the impact of the GR term on the
Newtonian solution is negligible.

Considering the eﬀective potential in both cases, it is easy to ﬁnd the

relationship [V an10]

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

r0 =

˜r0 − 3
2

α

Here, r0 >> r3, or equivalently x0 = 1/r0 << x3, and r3 = α(1 + 3α/2). It
should be immediately noticed that the above radial diﬀerence in a circular
and nearly circular motion translates into the corresponding diﬀerence in
circumferences, 3πα, that is exactly the GR perihelion advance eﬀect. A fatal
mistake in ﬁnal Einstein’s solution in the problem of planetary perihelion
advance is the assumption that the impact of the GR term on the roots x1
and x2 is negligible. Let us deliberate the problem in more details.

Let us assume for a moment that r1 = ˜r1, r2 = ˜r2, consequently, r0 = ˜r0.
Then the standard integration of I1 over half a period (from r1 to r2) makes
π. The similar analytical integration of I2 gives

The ﬁnal result would be the angular (perihelion) advance per one revolution
given by

(3.6)

or, for a circular orbit, ∆θ = 3πα/r0 = 6πrg/r0. There (x1 + x2) ≈ (2/r0)
while the eccentricity e << 1. The approximate analytical solution to the
equation (11) is supposed to be obtained for initial conditions analogous to
that in the corresponding classical problem and as a result of a small per-
turbation of physical parameters such as potential, kinetic and total energy
as well as the angular momentum. At the same time, a mathematical ap-
proximation is made due to the assumption that the impact of the GR term
on the classical roots x1 and x2 is negligible. As a result, the solution could
be understood as a periodic, not closed, orbit with a period νθ = 2π (see
Bergmann): x(θ) = (1/r0)(1 + e cos νθ), or

r0

r(θ) =

(1 + e cos νθ)

(3.7)

where ν ≈ (1 − 3rg/r0) is a factor of the deﬁcit of full angular rotation
in one classical revolution. To complete the revolution, a planet needs to
rotate through the additional angle 2π(3rg/r0), which should be observed, in
Clemence’s terms, in the inertial frame as a non-classical eﬀect of rotation
of orbital plane in the direction of planet motion (the claimed GR perihelion
advance eﬀect).

The fact of a physical inconsistency of the prediction (3.7) can be ver-
iﬁed by a substitution of the solution into the original Einstein’s equation
(11). The latter in the parametric form with geometrical parameters such as
eccentricity e and semilatus rectum p is given by

(3.8)

where the GR term is framed.

One immediately ﬁnds that the solution (3.7) satisﬁes the equation (3.8)
if and only if the GR term is removed from the equation. Once it is removed,
any value of ν does perfectly ﬁt the equation.
It is obvious that the eﬀect ∆θ = 2π(3rg/r0) is (falsely) originated because
of the radial shift ˜r0 − r0 = 3rg not taken into account. Let us consider an

20

almost circular orbit of a radius ˜r0 in the classical case and the radius r0 in
the GR case under similar conditions. The fact is that the GR term makes
a circumference of the circular orbit shorter by 3πα, which in turn makes
a deﬁcit of angle of rotation ∆π = 6πrg/r0. Therefore, in (3.3) we have to
drop the wrong assumption of the equality ˜r0 = r0 and account for the actual
shortage of circumference in the ﬁrst (presumably, “classical”) integral. It
makes the angle less than the expected value of π in a half a period, namely:

(cid:90) ˜r2−∆r

∆θ1 =

˜r1

I1(r)dr = π − 3

The second (perturbation) integral is not sensitive to the radius alternation
and gives a result (in agreement with Einstein’s result)

(3.9)

(3.10)

2

∆θ2 =

πα

which makes, after summation, a total π, that is, a zero angular advance.

We state that, if to follow Einstein’s weird derivation of the eﬀect and
correct mistakes, the result would be zero angular advance. Yet, numerous
question arise. For example, why one needs to derive the eﬀect by doing
clumsy “perturbation” approximations instead of solving the equation of
motion and directly calculating the eﬀect. How is it possible to replace the
proper time τ by the coordinate time t? Yet, it is inappropriate to give the
ﬁnal formula of the eﬀect in an inconvenient way obtained by Paul Gerber
in 1998 without mentioning the author (see Wikipedia).

This work should be read in the context of contemporary literature de-
voted to critical analysis of General Relativity validity, outside of “the main-
stream”. There are too many stumbles, puzzles, and misconceptions there,
all leading to GR foundations, the so-called Einstein’s Field Equations, which
are usually hidden from ordinary reader’s eyes.

The original text in German of the translated Einstein’s paper was in-
cluded without translation into Volume 6 of The Collected Papers of Albert
Einstein (further ColP ap for short); Volume 6 (1996), Doc.24. A. J. Knox,
M. J. Klein, and R. Schulmann, Editors. Princeton University Press. These
papers are assigned numbers Doc. namber. The paper under discussion is
referred to as Doc.24.
It was provided with Editor’s Notes numbered on
the paper margins. We retain these numbers in the attached original paper
(Doc.24) for making our N otes and comments on the selected spots in addi-
tion to our other comments, sometimes, with a reference to our work “Gen-
eral Relativity Problem of Mercury’s Perihelion Advance Revisited”, arXiv,

As a matter of fact, we found another edition of ColP ap in which Vol. 6
(1997) contains the above Einstein’s paper, Doc.24, translated into English
by Brian Doyle, and reprinted from A Source Book in Astronomy and Astro-
physics, 1900 - 1975, edited by Kenneth R. Lang and Owen Gingerich. There
are Editors’ Notes numbers on pages but actual Notes are not provided, and
mistakes made in the original publication are not corrected in the translation.

In the following N otes, corrected mistakes are listed.
1, 2. Einstein refers to the paper, Doc.21 in Vol. 6, “On the General
Theory of Relativity”, 1915. There he makes a further reference to the similar
paper (1914) in the Sitzungsberichte, Doc.9. He is concerned about a return
to the General Covariance Principle after partly abandoning it in works with
Grossman (the Entwurf theory). Here he states that the hypothesis about
the vanishing trace of “matter” tensor having the metric determinant being
equal to unity is in accord with the General Covariance of ﬁeld equations.
Next Einstein refers to the Addendum which is titled “On the General Theory
of Relativity, Addendum”, 1915, Doc.22. There he says: “In the following
