THE SUCCESSIVE MODELINGS

Astrophysics and cosmology experienced successive paradigmatic transitions. By early XX th century, the geomet-
rical view of A.Einstein converted Newton'’s dynamics into an approximation of solutions based on a ﬁeld equation.
Friedmann's time-dependent solutions gave some hope to get a deﬁnite deep understanding of cosmic dynamics.
Decades ago, cosmologists believed that the last step was to make a choice between three solutions, corresponding to
(−1, 0, +1) values of the curvature index k. and were convinced that the cosmologic constant was zero, or close to
zero. But a lot of discrepancies arose, year after year. Fritz Zwicky found that the random velocities of the galaxies in
clusters was too large. V.Rubin [1] deduced in 1979 that the mass of galaxies, as derived from photometric observa-
tions, could not balance the centifugal force for gazeous particles orbiting them. Observations of strong gravitational
lensing eﬀects could not be explained by visible matter action. At the end of the eighties the primeval universe,
revealed by CMB appeared strongly homogeneous, which could not be explained by Friedmann'’s model. Icing on
the cake : by the late 1990'’s data on distant supernovae did reveal that the cosmic expansion is accelerating instead
of slowing [2] [3]. Such evidence gave the 2011 Nobel Price to S.Perlmutter, Brian P.Schmidt and Adam G.Riess.

THE EXTRA-COMPONENTS OPTION

Over the last decades, necessary improvements to the models, either in astrophysics or in cosmology, consisted to
add new components: the primeval Universe homogeneity has been accounted for by assuming a new particle, the
inﬂaton; at galactic scales, halos of dark matter were introduced so as to ﬁt the observed rotation velocities; at larger
scales, studies of the weak lensing provided a new way for mapping the invisible. Finally, by the late years 90 the
cosmological model itself had to be deeply improved by adding a new component called the dark energy. So as the
model presently favored by cosmologists is the so-called concordance or ΛCDM model.
In this context, the magnitudes observed for high-redshift supernovae [3] have allowed to put constraints about non-
relativistic aspects of this model, i.e. the present Universe with a null pressure, and more exactly concerning the
distribution between dark matter and dark energy, ΩM and ΩΛ. With the ΛCDM model, the apparent magnitude
may be written such as :

(cid:34)

1 + z(cid:112)|κ| + S

(cid:17)(cid:35)
(cid:16)(cid:112)|κ| F (z)

where

F (z) =

and with 3 possibilities for S :
ΩM + ΩΛ < 1 : S(x) = sh(x) and κ = 1 − (ΩM + ΩΛ)
ΩM + ΩΛ = 1 : S(x) = x and κ = 1
ΩM + ΩΛ > 1 : S(x) = sin(x) and κ = 1 − (ΩM + ΩΛ)

Assuming a ﬂat Universe (ΩM + ΩΛ = 1), ﬁts to observed magnitudes resulted into (cf.
sis with statistical errors in ref.[4]) :

joint light curve analy-

ΩM = 0.289 ± 0.018

(ΩΛ = 1 − ΩM = 0.711)

Theses values are obtained with 740 points and 5 free parameters. Best ﬁt gives χ2/d.o.f. = 717/735.

OUR BIMETRIC OPTION

By early 1950s, cosmologists like H.Bondi [5] had assumed that the Universe might consist of both positive and
negative masses. However, his attempts to include this new view in Einstein's model immediately led him facing an
unmanageable problem : positive masses were attracting everything, while negative ones were repelling everything.
Hence the so-called runaway phenomenon : when two masses with opposite signs were interacting, the positive one
was running away followed by the negative one... And both particles were experiencing a uniform acceleration, with
a constant system energy because of their opposite signs... This problem has precluded any interest for particles with

negative mass and energy for half a century at least.
In 2014-2015, a bimetric model is put forward [6] [7] in which a g(+)
µ ν metric is associated with massive particles of
positive energy, and positive mass if they own, and another g(−)
µ ν metric for massive particles of negative energy, and
negative mass if they own. Both metrics form joint solutions to a system of coupled ﬁeld equations [8][6] derived from
a lagrangian derivation [9]. Then, the Newtonian approximation leads to a totally diﬀerent model :

• masses of same sign attract them according to Newton’s law
• masses of opposite sign repel them according to anti-Newton.

It is further assumed that particles of negative mass, even bearing an electric charge, interact with particles of positive
mass only through this anti-gravitational force, and not through electromagnetic, electroweak or strong interactions.
In such conditions any encounter between both species becomes impossible, as well as any electromagnetic detection,
including the optical range.

The nature of negative matter is explicated in [6], section 6. Such cohabitation for particles with opposite energies is
considered impossible in the context of QFT, but this only results from the arbitrary choice imposed to time-inversion
operator T, ﬁxed as anti-linear and anti-unitary, very exactly for excluding negative energy states [10].

One cannot invoke some void instability, due to ( +m , −m ) pair creations : there is no deﬁnite quantum theory

which gives a description of such phenomenon.

In reference [6] a time-dependent solution is built, based on isotropy and homogeneity hypothesis, i.e. FLRW

metrics, which provides exact joint solutions giving the scale factors (a(+) , a(−)).

The solution for positive species corresponds to k = −1 and :

(cid:16)

a(+)(u) = α2 ch2(u)
1 + sh(2u)

t(+)(u) = α2
c

2 + u

(cid:17)

Where we can see than ¨a(+) > 0 which qualitatively ﬁts observation.
In the following we will develop this solution, which owns no free parameters, to derive the values of apparent
magnitude, versus redshift.For sake of simplicity, we will now write a(+) ≡ a.
The deceleration parameter q is :

And the Hubble constant is :

CONCLUSION

We have reviewed the interpretation of the SNle data based on ΛCDM model, by introducing a new analysis based
on our Janus bimetric cosmological model. Although resulting charts are comparable , they rely on a fundamentally
diﬀerent approach. The ΛCDM model is based on an description of the universe, where unknown components have
been added (ﬁrst : dark matter, and today : dark energy) with free parameters adjustment to ﬁt the observations,
while our model is self-consistent and based on a geometrical theory including a Lagrangian derivation giving an
excellent ﬁt to the observational data, magnitude versus redshift.
The deceleration parameter q0 is found to be small and there is no need in our model to introduce a non zero
cosmological constant to ﬁt the so far available data.

From Eq. (10), (15)) and (16)) we get :

and also

In terms of the time t used in the FRLW metric, the light emitted by Ge at time te is observed on G0 at a time
t0 (te > t0) and the distance l travelled by photons (ds2 = 0) is related to the time diﬀerence t and then to the u
parameter through the relation :

We can also relate the distance l to the distance marker r by (using Friedman's metric with k = −1) :

So we can write :

We need now to link ue and u0 to observable quantities q0, H0, z. From Eq. (8) we get :

Inserting Eq. (17) and (18) into Eq. (14), after a 'few' technical manipulations, using at the end Eq.(11) and
considering the constraint that 1 + 2q0z > 0, we get :

Which is similar to Mattig’s work [11] with usual Friedmann solutions where q0 > 0, here we have always q0 < 0.

The total energy received per unit area and unit time interval measured by bolometers is related to the luminosity :

Using Eq. (19), the bolometric magnitude can therefore be written as :
