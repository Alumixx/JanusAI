Contributions to Einstein’s theory of gravitation.

by L u d w i g F l a m m .

A . E i n s t e i n has signiﬁcantly improved the understanding of his new theory of
gravitation by the summary which he gave recently.1)∗1 The popular accounts given by
M . B o r n2) and E . F r e u n d l i c h3) have also been clarifying. However, the exact
solutions for gravitational ﬁelds with spherical symmetry, which were found and dis-
cussed by K . S c h w a r z s c h i l d4) are particularly instructive. In the present lines,
the author wishes to add further conclusions to these.
In particular, the remarkable
properties of the gravitational ﬁeld will be made quite clear.
In this way, the phys-
ical assumptions of the general theory of relativity might perhaps appear even more
transparent. Furthermore, the motion of light in a gravitational ﬁeld can be treated
more accurately than before. Likewise, a strict numerical computation of the constants
relevant for the gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun might be desirable.

It is advisable to ﬁrst consider the case of the gravitational ﬁeld inside a ball of
incompressible ﬂuid, which was discussed by S c h w a r z s c h i l d later. The presence
of the gravitational ﬁeld manifests itself by the fact that M i n k o w s k i’s line element
can no longer be reduced to the special form

where the coordinates have already been chosen in a particularly suitable way. Here, χ
is a coordinate which increases radially from the centre of the ﬂuid ball, reaching the
value χa at the boundary surface, and ϑ and ϕ are the usual spherical coordinates. The
constant ρ0 stands for the density of the ﬂuid ball and κ stands for the gravitational
constant of E i n s t e i n’s theory, which has the value

It is practical to write for the line element

that is, to split it into a temporal part

(cid:2)

Here the new constant

(cid:3)

was introduced. As S c h w a r z s c h i l d remarks, the above expression for d σ2 repre-
sents nothing other than the line element of the spherical space with radius of curvature
R0; hence, this must be the geometry inside the ﬂuid ball.

In order to gain an overview of the relations it is enough, because of the spherical
symmetry, to consider the geometry of any planar section through the origin, thus for
ϑ = π

(cid:2)
2 . In this case the line element reads

(cid:3)

d σe

2 = R0

2

d χ2 + sin2 χ d ϕ2

.

(2)

One can see that these are the same metric properties as on a sphere of radius R0.
According to Fig. 1, one can think of this as being generated by rotating the circle
around the vertical diameter AB. Then the meridional element of arc-length is

if R0 is the radius of the meridian circle, the element of arc-length on the parallel circles
is

if ϕ is the angle of rotation and

denotes the distance from the axis of rotation. Hence, the line element on this sphere is
given by the formula (2) as well.

A striking diﬀerence of the geometry on the sphere compared to E u c l i d e a n
geometry consists, for example, in the fact that the circumferences of concentric circles

do not increase proportionally to the radius σm, but instead they are obtained from it
by the complicated formula

Thus, the circumference reaches a maximum for

to decrease again and to shrink back to zero completely for

(3)

while in Euclidean geometry only the equality sign holds. Exactly the same relations
must hold for radius and circumference of the circles within every central planar section
of the ﬂuid ball.

For a better understanding of the following, a small rearrangement will be made.

equation (3) can also be written as

d σm = R0 d χ,

d σn = R · d ϕ,

R = R0 sin χ

One has

and, hence,

Since

and, in this form, can be read oﬀ directly from Fig. 1, because χ also represents the
angle between the element of arc-length and the horizontal. Therefore, the formula (2)
can also be given in the form

d σe

2 =

+ R2d ϕ2.

d R2
cos2 χ

(2’)

But then this is the general expression for the line element on a surface of rotation,
where χ denotes the angle that the tangent to the meridional curve, which can be quite
arbitrary, makes with the equatorial plane.

§2. Now we can, in an analogous way, examine the ﬁrst case which was treated
by S c h w a r z s c h i l d, the gravitational ﬁeld of a point mass. The line-element in its
simplest form has the same structure as above and reads

(cid:5)

(cid:6)

d s2 =

1 − α
R

(cid:2)

− R2

d t2 − d R2
1 − α

(cid:3)

d ϑ2 + sin2 ϑ d ϕ2

.

One quantity is completely new in this expression, the constant α, and has the value

α =

2k2M0

,

c2

where M0 stands for the central mass, as would be obtained from astronomical measure-
ments. The line-element will be decomposed again according to formula (1).

The spatial part of the line-element is again of a non-Euclidean nature. Once more,
due to the spherical symmetry it seems to be enough to restrict the consideration to the
metric properties in an arbitrary planar section through the origin, i.e., to ϑ = π
2 . Now
one obtains

(4)

This line-element is also of the form (2’), because one can put

d σe

2 =

+ R2 d ϕ2.

d R2

and it is also identical with a line-element on a surface of rotation. Denoting by z the
coordinate in the direction of the rotational axis, the equation for the meridional curve
follows from

(cid:4)

as

This describes a parabola with parameter

whose equation is referred to the axis and directrix as coordinate lines, as seen in Fig. 2.
Thus, the expression (4) is identical with the line-element of that surface which is ob-
tained by rotating this parabola around the directrix ZZ(cid:2).

The meridional radius of principal curvature of this surface of rotation is

So one ﬁnds for the G a u ß curvature of this rotational paraboloid

However, for the sphere discussed in the previous section the G a u ß curvature is

i.e., positive and constant. For the present rotational paraboloid the curvature is neg-
ative and variable; it decreases in absolute value with increasing R. And for this very

123

Republication of: Contributions to Einstein’s theory of gravitation

reason the geometry on that surface is even more involved. Though on the sphere the
dependence of the circumference on the radius was not as simple as in Euclidean ge-
ometry, it was uniform over the entire sphere. For the rotational paraboloid at hand
it is additionally dependent on the location of the circles on the surface. The metric
properties in any planar section through the point mass are of exactly the same nature.
§3. The mass point, which generates the gravitational ﬁeld, is found at the vertex
S of the meridional parabola. The surface of rotation of the branch Sπ of the parabola,
as seen in Fig. 3, already maps to the full sectional plane through the centre, preserving
the metric properties. The peculiarity that the point mass has a ﬁnite circumference,
an equator of length 2πα, as S c h w a r z s c h i l d has already emphasized, is clearly
noticeable in the ﬁgure.

Fig. 3

In the exterior of the ﬂuid ball, as discussed in the ﬁrst paragraph, the line-element
is the same as for a central point mass. The relationship between the interior of the
ﬂuid ball and its exterior is given by boundary conditions, which simply consist of the
fact that on the boundary the coeﬃcients of the two line elements together with their
ﬁrst derivatives have the same value.

For our representation of the metric properties in a plane through the centre, this
implies that the sphere, which represents the geometry in the interior of the ﬂuid, must
touch the rotational paraboloid which is valid in the exterior. In Fig. 3 this is indicated
by the circular arc GAG(cid:2), which touches the two parabolas. Now, the surface of rotation
for the combined curve AGπ uniquely represents the entire sectional plane through
the centre preserving the metric properties. The angle χ, which grows on the spherical
segment up to a maximal value χa at the boundary, slowly decreases along the subsequent
part of the rotational paraboloid down to zero. The whole could be regarded as some
kind of a funnel surface.

§4. Thus, the dimensions of the elementary rulers, which are represented by d σ, are
subject to such inﬂuences in the gravitational ﬁeld that using them for measurements—
this is called “natural measurements of space”—does not, in general, lead to a Euclidean

123

 72  Page 8 of 12

geometry. A quite analogous fact holds for the measurement of time by elementary
clocks, the so called “natural time measurement”, which is represented by d τ. In general,
it is no longer possible to simply identify d τ with d t as in the M i n k o w s k i world, but
the connection is more involved. However, the speed of light is given by the equation∗2

as in the M i n k o w s k i world. From this one ﬁnds

d s2 = 0

d σ
d τ

= 1;

thus, the naturally measured speed of light is constant.
In particular, the units are
usually chosen from the outset in such a way that this constant assumes the value 1. In
this sense, also in the general theory of relativity the postulate of the constancy of the
speed of light holds.

It is of importance to have a closer look at the signiﬁcance of the proposition just
derived. Expressed in coordinates, which are mere parameters in the formulation of the
gravitational ﬁeld, the speed of light is by no means constant; in fact, it has diﬀerent
values in diﬀerent directions even at the same location. But, when measured with mate-
rial rods and clocks, the propagation of light also appears homogeneous and isotropic in
a gravitational ﬁeld. Choosing as an elementary clock the molecule which emits the red
cadmium line, and ﬁxing its period as the unit of time, one immediately realises that —
due to that constancy of the speed of light— the metric unit of length must be covered
at all times and in all locations by the same number of wavelengths of the red cadmium
line. Fixing, in addition, the elementary rod to be the lattice distance of the sodium
chloride crystal, then one arrives at a like conclusion in view of the constancy of the
“naturally measured” speed of light. Thus, the theory of general relativity is based on
the fundamental assumption that, for instance, the ratio between the wavelength of the
red cadmium line and the lattice constant of the sodium chloride crystal is an absolute
constant. Even in a general gravitational ﬁeld, it must be completely independent of the
location, the orientation and the instant of time.

Therefore, if the elementary rulers and clocks are inﬂuenced by the gravitational
ﬁeld, then the propagation of light must be inﬂuenced in exactly the same way, so that
when compared to each other they do not show any diﬀerences. The same must hold
for all the other physical phenomena. This might be why one can describe the motion
of a point particle by the simple variational equation

(cid:7) P2

d s = 0,

(5)

even though the expression contains only quantities related to the metric properties. The
inﬂuence of the gravitational ﬁeld on the motion of a point particle is entirely in line
with the change exhibited by elementary rods and clocks; relative to one another, the

behaviour of the phenomena has remained the same. In this way, the general principle
of relativity can be given a more concrete formulation.
§5. Since light propagation satisﬁes the condition∗3

d s2 = 0,

it must be contained as a special case within the equations (5) for the general motion of
a point particle. Indeed, one only needs to put to zero the one constant h in the interme-
diate integrals for the particle motion that have been derived by S c h w a r z s c h i l d5)
in order to satisfy the above condition. Hence, in the gravitational ﬁeld of a central mass
the equations for the propagation of light read:

(cid:5)

The second equation represents Kepler’s second law∗4 and, since the speed of light at
inﬁnity equals 1, the constant Δ has a very clear meaning. It is nothing else than the
length of the perpendicular from the centre to the light ray, if it were not changing its
direction coming from inﬁnity; it is, so to speak, the distance Δ, by which the light ray
at inﬁnity misses the centre.

After introducing

the equation for the trajectory derived from the system (6) reads quite analogously to
S c h w a r z s c h i l d’s

propagating in a straight line. Hence, the light ray incurs the deﬂection

in the gravitational ﬁeld, which coincides with the formula6) calculated by E i n s t e i n
for this case. However, the derivation given here is completely identical to the calculation
of the perihelion movement of the planets7). Hence, the inﬂuence of the gravitational
ﬁeld on the light rays has the same cause. Therefore, one can also regard the deﬂection
of light rays as a perihelion shift.

The value of the coordinate R reached by the light ray element at the perihelion can

also be calculated. It follows from the system of equations (6) for

S c h w a r z s c h i l d. However, in the following the author wishes to present a uniﬁed
and exact recalculation of the relevant constants. The astronomical quantities employed
were taken from the table of constants at the end of the “Theoretische Astronomie”
by W . K l i n k e r f u e s8). Thus, in particular, the calculations used the equatorial
horizontal parallax of the Sun

and the speed of light

π = 8.80

(cid:2)(cid:2)

c = 2.9986 · 1010cm sec

−1,

as ﬁxed at the astronomy conference in Paris. The equatorial radius of the Earth was
taken from B e s s e l’s value.

For the product of gravitational constant and solar mass one obtains

From this one determines the value of the important quantity α as

k2M0 = 1.324 · 1026cm3 sec

−2.

α = 2.945 · 105cm,

which was given by S c h w a r z s c h i l d only approximately as 3 km. It is easy to see
that due to the bending of the light rays the true solar radius, which is determined from
the apparent solar radius in the usual way, is in reality the quantity denoted by Δ in
the previous section. We denote this quantity by Δa if it is referred to the special case
of a light ray grazing the surface of the Sun. From the apparent solar radius according
to A u w e r s one obtains

Δa = 6.9545 · 1010cm

and one should determine the corresponding value for Ra for the solar radius from equa-
tion (8). However, with the current status of the accuracy of astronomical measurements
one can still identify the quantities Ra and Δa. With the numbers given above one ob-
tains for the total deﬂection of a light ray grazing the surface of the Sun

in good agreement with the calculation by E i n s t e i n.

Finally, here are the constants which one obtains when the Sun is regarded as a ball

of incompressible ﬂuid. The relation

reveals the angle χa at the solar surface as a small quantity for whose calculation the
formula

suﬃces. This yields

therefore this funnel surface mapping the geometry within a central cut of the solar
system is quite ﬂat. Again, for the radius of curvature

of the spherical space inside the Sun the simpliﬁed calculation

suﬃces. The numerical calculation shows that the radius of curvature R0 in the interior
is 486 times larger than the radius Ra of the Sun. Or, computed in centimetres,

which would represent a distance reaching from the Sun out to the planetoid belt.

Every planar cut inside a ball of incompressible ﬂuid carries the same geometry as a
sphere (§1). Around a central mass every central cut has the same geometry as a surface
which is generated by rotating a parabola around its directrix (§2). The spherical shell
which represents every central cut of the ﬂuid ball preserving its metric properties must
touch the segment of the rotational paraboloid which serves the same purpose in the
exterior (§3). The principle of a constant, and notably “naturally measured”, speed of
light is a fundamental assumption also for the general theory of relativity (§4). The
deﬂection of light rays passing by a central mass can also be interpreted as the motion of
the perihelion similarly to the planets (§5). The deviations from the Euclidean geometry
in the solar system are extremely small (§6).
