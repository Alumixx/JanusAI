In the following—in the sense of the axiomatic method—I would like to develop,
essentially from two simple axioms, a new system of basic equations of physics, of
 the solution to the problems of
ideal beauty and containing, I believe, 
Einstein and of Mie. I reserve for later communications the detailed development and
particularly the special application of my basic equations to the fundamental ques-
tions of the theory of electricity.

3 Mie’s world functions do not contain exactly these arguments; in particular the usage of the argu-
ments (2) goes back to Born. However, what is characteristic of Mie’s electrodynamics is precisely
the introduction and use of such a world function in Hamilton’s principle.
Orthogonal invariance was already postulated by Mie. In the axiom II formulated above, Einstein’s
fundamental basic idea of general invariance ﬁnds its simplest expression, even if Hamilton’s princi-
ple plays only a subsidiary role with Einstein, and his functions 
are by no means general invari-
ants, and also do not contain the electric potentials.

We denote the left sides of the equations (4), (5) respectively by

for short.

Let us call equations (4) the fundamental equations of gravitation, and equations
(5)  the  fundamental  electrodynamic  equations,  or  generalized  Maxwell  equations.
Due to the theorem stated above, the four equations (5) can be viewed as a conse-
quence  of  equations  (4),  that  is,  because  of  that  mathematical  theorem  we  can
directly make the claim that in the sense as explained the electrodynamic phenomena
are effects of gravitation. I regard this | insight as the simple and very surprising solu-
tion of the problem of Riemann, who was the ﬁrst to search for a theoretical connec-
tion between gravitation and light.

In the following we use the easily proved fact that, if

The most important aim is now the formulation of the concept of energy, and the

derivation of the energy theorem solely on the basis of the two axioms I and II.

that  is,  from  the  gravitational  equations  (4)  there  follow  indeed  the  four  mutually
independent linear combinations (27) of the basic electrodynamic equations (5) and
their  ﬁrst  derivatives.  This  is  the  exact  mathematical  expression  of  the  statement
claimed in general above concerning the character of electrodynamics as a conse-
quence of gravitation. |

According to our assumption 

;
 must be a function of certain four general invariants, which correspond to
therefore 
the special orthogonal invariants given by Mie, and of which the two simplest ones
are these:

The simplest and most straightforward ansatz for

 are constants.

As one can see, the few simple assumptions expressed in axioms I and II sufﬁce
with  appropriate  interpretation  to  establish  the  theory:  through  it  not  only  are  our
views of space, time, and motion fundamentally reshaped in the sense explained by
Einstein, but I am also convinced that through the basic equations established here
the most intimate, presently hidden processes in the interior of the atom will receive
an explanation, and in particular that generally a reduction of all physical constants to
mathematical  constants  must  be  possible—even  as  in  the  overall  view  thereby  the
possibility  approaches  that  physics  in  principle  becomes  a  science  of  the  type  of
geometry: surely the highest glory of the axiomatic method, which as we have seen
takes the powerful instruments of analysis, namely variational calculus and theory of
invariants, into its service.
