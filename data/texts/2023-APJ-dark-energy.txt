Abstract

Observations have found black holes spanning 10 orders of magnitude in mass across most of cosmic history. The
Kerr black hole solution is, however, provisional as its behavior at inﬁnity is incompatible with an expanding
universe. Black hole models with realistic behavior at inﬁnity predict that the gravitating mass of a black hole can
increase with the expansion of the universe independently of accretion or mergers, in a manner that depends on the
black hole’s interior solution. We test this prediction by considering the growth of supermassive black holes in
elliptical galaxies over 0 < z  2.5. We ﬁnd evidence for cosmologically coupled mass growth among these black
holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98% conﬁdence. The redshift dependence of the mass
growth implies that, at z  7, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmological energy density to
Friedmann’s equations. The continuity equation then requires that black holes contribute cosmologically as
vacuum energy. We further show that black hole production from the cosmic star formation history gives the value
of ΩΛ measured by Planck while being consistent with constraints from massive compact halo objects. We thus
propose that stellar remnant black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy, explaining the onset of
accelerating expansion at z ∼ 0.7.

1. Introduction

Astrophysical black holes (BHs), with masses spanning a
few to several billion solar masses, are found in systems
ranging from stellar binaries to supermassive BHs (SMBHs) in
the centers of galaxies. Observations of gravitational waves

tion et al. (2019) and Akiyama et al. (2022), have shown
excellent consistency with the Kerr
solution on
timescales from milliseconds to hours, and spatial scales of
up to milliparsecs. BHs are thus established as a universal
phenomenon, across at least 10 orders of magnitude in mass.
Existing models for astrophysical BHs are necessarily
provisional. They feature singularities, horizons, and unrealistic

boundary conditions27 (e.g.,Visser 2009). Though singularities
and horizons are of theoretical interest (e.g., Harlow 2016), the
Kerr solution reduces to ﬂat spacetime at spatial inﬁnity. This is
incompatible with our universe, which is in concordance with a
perturbed Robertson Walker (RW) cosmology to sub-percent
precision
2020; Dodelson &
Schmidt 2020). Thus, regardless of singularities and horizons,
Kerr is only appropriate for intervals of time short compared to
the reciprocal expansion rate of the universe, and can only be
consistently interpreted as an approximation to some more
general solution.

(e.g., Aghanim et

Efforts to construct a BH model in general relativity (GR)
with realistic RW boundary conditions have been ongoing for
nearly a century, but have met with limited success. Early work
by McVittie (1933) generalized the Schwarzschild solution to
arbitrary RW spacetimes. Nolan (1993) constructed a non-
singular interior for this solution, and progress has been made
in understanding its horizon/causal structure (e.g., Kaloper
et al. 2010; Lake & Abdelqader 2011; Faraoni et al. 2012; da
Silva et al. 2013). Faraoni & Jacques (2007) constructed
solutions featuring dynamical phenomena such as horizons that
comove with the universe’s expansion, evolution of interior
energy densities and pressures, and time-varying mass. These
solutions are signiﬁcant, because they show how heuristic
application of Birkhoff’s theorem in cosmological settings can
fail in the presence of strong gravity28 (see Lemaître 1931;
Einstein & Straus 1945; Callan et al. 1965; Peebles 1993).
Time-varying mass in particular has been studied by Guariento
et al. (2012) and Maciel et al. (2015), but its interpretation
remains largely unexplored. All of these solutions, however,
are incompatible with Kerr on short timescales because they do
not spin. A BH solution that satisﬁes observational constraints
at small and large scales simultaneously has yet to be found.
Progress on these problems in GR has become possible with
advances that resolve a long-standing ambiguity in Fried-
mann’s equations (e.g., Ellis & Stoeger 1987).
In RW
cosmology,
the metric is position-independent and has no
preferred directions in space. In order for Einstein’s equations
to be consistent, the stress-energy must share these properties.
Einstein’s equations, however, give no prescription for
converting the actual, position-dependent, distribution of
stress-energy observed at late times into a position-independent
source. Croker & Weiner
resolved this averaging
ambiguity, showing how the Einstein–Hilbert action gives the
necessary relation between the actual distribution of stress-
energy and the source for the RW model.

(2019)

A consequence of this result is that relativistic material,
located anywhere, can become cosmologically coupled to the
expansion rate. This has implications for singularity-free BH
models, such as those with vacuum energy interiors (e.g.,
Gliner 1966; Dymnikova 1992; Chapline et al. 2002; Mazur &
Mottola 2004; Lobo 2006; Mazur & Mottola 2015; Dymnikova
& Galaktionov 2016; Posada 2017; Beltracchi & Gon-
dolo 2019; Posada & Chirenti 2019). The stress-energy within
BHs like these, and therefore their gravitating mass, can vary in
time with the expansion rate. The effect is analogous to the

behavior at inﬁnity, if applicable.

The presence or absence of cosmologically coupled mass in
BHs strongly constrains observationally viable BH solutions.
In general, the way in which a BH’s mass M changes in time

In this paper, we perform a direct test of BH mass growth
due to cosmological coupling. A recent study by Farrah et al.
(2023) compares the BH masses MBH and host galaxy stellar
masses M* of “red-sequence” elliptical galaxies over 6–9 Gyr,
from the current epoch back to z ∼ 2.7. The study ﬁnds that the
BHs increase in mass over this time period by a factor of
8–20× relative to the stellar mass. The growth factor depends
on redshift, with a higher factor at higher redshifts. Because
SMBH growth via accretion is expected to be insigniﬁcant in
red-sequence ellipticals, and because galaxy–galaxy mergers
should not on average increase SMBH mass relative to stellar
mass, this preferential increase in SMBH mass is challenging to
explain via standard galaxy assembly pathways (Farrah et al.
2023, Section 5). We here determine if this mass increase is
consistent with cosmological

We then determine the value of k needed to align each high-
redshift sample with the local sample in the MBH–M* plane. If
the growth in BH mass is due to cosmological coupling alone,
regardless of sample redshift, the same value of k will be
recovered.

To compute the posterior distributions in k for each
combination, we apply the pipeline developed by Farrah
et al. (2023), which we brieﬂy summarize. Realizations of each
galaxy sample are drawn from the sample with its reported
uncertainties. The likelihood function applies the expected
measurement and selection bias corrections to the realizations,
as appropriate for each sample. The de-biased, and so best
actual estimate, BH mass of each galaxy is then shifted to its
mass at z = 0 according to Equation (1) with some value of k.
Using the Epps–Singleton test, an entire high-redshift realiza-
tion is then compared against a realization of
the local
ellipticals, where BH masses are shifted to z = 0 in the same
way. The result is a probability that can be used to reject the

We present posterior distributions in k, for each high-redshift

dependence of mass growth translates to the same value k ∼ 3
across all ﬁve comparisons, as predicted by growth due to
cosmological coupling alone. As further veriﬁcation, we

3.1. Implications

Our result provides a single-channel explanation for the
disparity in SMBH masses between local ellipticals and their
7–10 Gyr antecedents (Farrah et al. 2023). Furthermore, the
recovered value of k ∼ 3 is consistent with SMBHs having
vacuum energy interiors. Our study thus makes the existence
argument for a cosmologically realistic BH solution in GR with
a non-singular vacuum energy interior.

Equation (1) implies that a population of k ∼ 3 BHs will gain
mass proportional to a3. Within an RW cosmology, however,
all objects dilute in number density proportional to a−3. When
accretion becomes subdominant to growth by cosmological
coupling, this population of BHs will contribute in aggregate as
a nearly cosmologically constant energy density. From
conservation of stress-energy, this is only possible if the BHs
also contribute cosmological pressure equal to the negative of
their energy density, making k ∼ 3 BHs a cosmological dark
energy species.

Figure 2. Cosmic star formation rate densities (SFRDs) capable of producing the necessary k = 3 BH density to give ΩΛ = 0.68 (green, solid). The details of the
model are given in Appendix A. The upper bound of the viable region adopts a Kroupa (2002) initial mass function (IMF) at all redshifts with the least amount of
remnant accretion required to produce ΩΛ with a decreasing power-law SFRD model (red, solid). The lower bound adopts the top-heavy IMF of Harikane et al.
(2022a) at z > 7 (blue, solid). Two middle lines show the impact of a top-heavy IMF at z > 7, but no remnant accretion (green, solid); and higher accretion, but with a
Kroupa IMF (orange, solid). Existing measurements of the SFRD via IR (Rowan-Robinson et al. 2018, red, squares), γ-ray bursts (Kistler et al. 2009, orange, stars),
FIR (Algera et al. 2023, brown, xs), and rest-frame UV via the JWST (Harikane et al. 2022a; Donnan et al. 2022, purple, dots), (Bouwens et al. 2022, blue, dots) are
over-plotted. The UV points can vary ∼−1 dex depending upon IMF assumptions and UV luminosity integration bounds. Consistency occurs with consumption of
<3% of the baryon fraction Ωb after cosmic dawn. The results assume stellar ﬁrst light at zå = 25 (Harikane et al. 2022b, Figure 25) but are typical of the scenario for
15 < zå < 35. Also indicated are the redshifts probed by 21 cm experiments.

3.2. ΩΛ from the Cosmic Star Formation History

If k ∼ 3 BHs contribute as a cosmological dark energy
species, a natural question is whether they can contribute all of
the observed ΩΛ. We test this by assuming that: (1) BHs couple
with k = 3, consistent with our measured value; (2) BHs are the
only source for ΩΛ, and (3) BHs are made solely from the
deaths of massive stars. Under these assumptions, the total BH
mass from the cosmic history of star formation (and subsequent
cosmological mass growth)
consistent with
ΩΛ = 0.68.

should be

formation rate density (SFRD)

In Appendix A we construct a simple model of the cosmic
star
that allows exploring
combinations of stellar production rate, stellar initial mass
function (IMF), and accretion history. Figure 2 displays models
that produce the Planck measured value of ΩΛ = 0.68
(Aghanim et al. 2020) with the indicated IMF and Eddington
ratio λe. Any monotonically decreasing path inside the ﬁlled
region produces ΩΛ = 0.68 for some observationally viable
IMF and accretion history, consuming at most 3% of baryons.
This baryon consumption is compatible with the results of
Macquart et al. (2020), who ﬁnd that Ωb at low redshift agrees
with Ωb inferred from the big bang to within 50%.

It follows from Equation (1) that cosmological coupling in
BHs with k = 3 will produce a BH population with masses
>102Me. If these BHs are distributed in galactic halos, they
will form a population of MAssive Compact Halo Objects
(MACHOs). In Appendix B, we consider the consistency of
SFRDs in Figure 2 with MACHO constraints from wide halo
binaries, microlensing of objects in the Large Magellanic
Cloud, and the existence of ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs). We
conclude that non-singular k = 3 BHs are in harmony with

MACHO constraints while producing ΩΛ = 0.68, driving late-
time accelerating expansion.

4. Future Tests

Further tests of cosmological coupling in BHs are essential
to conﬁrm or refute our proposal. We list some examples
below, highlighting possible tensions.

4.1. Signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background
A population of k ∼ 3 BHs are a dark energy species. Thus,
their distribution in space need not trace baryons or dark matter
at all times. For example, Croker et al. (2020b) study the spatial
distribution of k ∼ 3 BHs with anisotropic stress (e.g., Cattoen
et al. 2005) at ﬁrst order in cosmological perturbation theory.
Anisotropic stress within individual BHs leads to an effective
ﬂuid at ﬁrst-order that resists clustering and can even drive the
spatial distribution to uniformity.30 Resistance to clustering is
computed from the non-singular BH model, of which there is
currently none preferred (Section 4.6). Some amount of
anisotropic stress is, however, necessary to satisfy constraints
on the galaxy two-point correlation function (Croker et al.
2020b).

Anisotropic stress from cosmologically coupled BHs at
zå = 25 would maximally impact
the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) via the Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect at
ℓ = 5, with lesser impacts at ℓ  5 (e.g., Koivisto & Mota 2006;
Dodelson & Schmidt 2020). The low ℓ  30 multipoles of the
CMB TT anisotropy spectrum are anomalous in several
respects (e.g., Schwarz et al. 2016) and with amplitude in

Figure 3. (Vertical bars) Fraction of z = 0 halo density contributed by k = 3 BHs, as produced by the indicated SFRDs in Figure 2. Models are ordered by increasing
SFRD power-law slope, with colors set to agree with the model lines in Figure 2. Also displayed (gray, shaded) are current constraints on MACHOs from
microlensing (Blaineau et al. 2022), wide halo binary disruption (Monroy-Rodríguez & Allen 2014; Tyler et al. 2022), and ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy disruption
(Brandt 2016). Noting the broken vertical axis, the microlensing and halo binary constraints are easily satisﬁed. Dwarf galaxy constraints may discriminate candidate
SFRD and IMF combinations. As shown, UFD constraints are overly conservative because they do not account for the decrease in comoving BH mass density at
earlier times, as will be present in the k > 0 coupled scenario. The effects of accretion at z > 7, as well as adopting a top-heavy IMF (Appendix A), are visible as a
decreased fraction in the intermediate-mass BH range. Horizontal bars show the fraction of present-day ΩΛ contributed by each mass bin. Mass bins that contribute
<5% of ΩΛ are unlabeled for clarity. Color gradients indicate mass binning and are common to both vertical and horizontal bars. Contributions less than 1%, including
negligible contributions omitted in the vertical bars, are also shown in log scaling. Here, contributions are ordered by density fraction.

excess of cosmic variance at ℓ = 5 (e.g., Planck Collaboration
et al. 2020). Any imprint of BH production at cosmic dawn on
the CMB at low ℓ provides a precision test of non-singular BH
models, and could enable independent constraint of the high-
z SFRD.

4.2. Strong Lensing of γ-Ray Bursts

The prevalence of strong gravitationally lensed γ-ray bursts
(GRBs) has been used to estimate the comoving density of
intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs; Paynter et al. 2021, see also,
e.g., Wang et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2022;
Kalantari et al. 2022; Liao et al. 2022; Lin et al. 2022). GRBs
probe IMBHs at scales much greater than the nonlinearity scale
of ∼6 Mpc, complementing ∼50 kpc MACHO constraints

The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 944:L31 (9pp), 2023 February 20
(Appendix B). At these larger scales, the prediction of uniform
spatial distribution from anisotropic stress (Section 4.1) is
directly applicable.

Xiao & Schaefer (2011) report GRBs with spectroscopic
redshifts and ﬁnd that 90% of GRBs have redshifts z > 0.25,
with 50% occurring at z > 1.5. Across these distances, k ∼ 3
cosmological coupling of BHs strongly impacts the comoving
mass density of lenses along the line of sight, reducing it by
factors of at least 2–16×. Existing analyses do not incorporate
this impact of cosmological coupling on the optical depth.
Thus, a direct comparison of measured ΩIMBH against
the
simulated BH populations in Appendix B is not yet possible.
is to incorporate cosmological
coupling into the optical depth calculation. In general, a
spectroscopic redshift
is not available for candidate lensed
GRBs, signiﬁcantly weakening measurement of ΩIMBH (e.g.,
Paynter et al. 2021). Consistency with our population
predictions, when evaluated at the lens redshift, could help to
constrain such measurements.

A promising future test

4.3. Stellar Mass BH–BH Merger Rates

The population properties of observable binary BH mergers
probe cosmological coupling because their inspiral time can be
a signiﬁcant fraction of the age of the universe. If k > 0, then
the component masses of binary BH systems observed by
gravitational-wave detectors are not representative of the birth
masses. This impacts the interpretation of merging populations
of BHs (The LIGO Scientiﬁc Collaboration et al. 2021) and the
stochastic background (Christensen 2019; Arzoumanian et al.
2020). Coupled mass growth further leads to accelerated orbital
decay, though the rate of this decay may be model dependent
(see Hadjidemetriou 1963; Croker et al. 2020a). This aspect
affects both the observed mass spectrum and rate of binary BH
mergers. For example,
in the absence of cosmological
coupling, stellar-mass binary BH systems with semimajor axis
0.3 au can only merge within a Hubble time when highly
eccentric. Conversely, with k  0.2, systems with initial
semimajor axes 0.1 < R < 104 au can merge within less than
a Hubble time. This can lead to signiﬁcant increases in merger
rate. Competing with this effect, however, is that mergers can
happen so quickly after remnant formation that they merge at a
redshift beyond the detection limit of current generation
observatories.

4.4. Direct Measurement from Orbital Period Decay

Direct measurement of altered orbital decay rate in binary
BH systems with proposed space-based observatories like
LISA (Armano et al. 2018), DECIGO (Sato et al. 2017), and
Taiji (Gong et al. 2021) is likely not possible because these
observatories can only track orbital decay in the ﬁnal few
months. Decade-scale electromagnetic observations of a
pulsar–BH orbit, however, would provide sufﬁcient precision
to measure cosmological coupling directly (e.g., Weisberg et al.
2010; Croker & Weiner 2019).

4.5. Stellar Mass BHs and Stellar Evolution

Farrah et al.
coupling of k = 3 and adopting contemporary stellar population
synthesis estimates can lead to an overabundance of BHs with
masses >120Me. While uncertainties in binary BH formation
channels (Zevin et al. 2021; Mandel & Farmer 2022), massive
binary star evolutionary physical processes (Broekgaarden
et al. 2022), nuclear reaction rates (Farmer et al. 2020),
supernova core collapse physics (Patton & Sukhbold 2020),
and SFRD and metallicity evolution (Chruślińska 2022) leave
population model ﬂexibility,
there are known young BHs
within X-ray binaries with mass ∼20Me (e.g., Miller-Jones
et al. 2021). If this BH mass is typical of young stellar remnants
at z  5, then the distribution of remnant binary semimajor axes
and eccentricities becomes constrained so as not to produce
overly massive BH–BH mergers. An important test for k = 3
BHs is whether such constraints are plausible.

4.6. Theoretical Considerations

As described in Section 1, there are known exact solutions
with each of the following properties: strong spin, arbitrary RW
asymptotics, dynamical mass, and interior vacuum energy
equation of state. Our result implies the existence, within GR,
of an exact solution with all of these properties. Currently, there
is no known solution that possesses all four, though there are
two (e.g.,
known solutions with various combinations of
Guariento et al. 2012; Dymnikova & Galaktionov 2016).
Finding solutions that feature all four properties is an important
theoretical step forward.

It is also interesting that a link between BHs and late-time
accelerating expansion has been independently suggested
within frameworks distinct from GR. Afshordi (2008) and
Prescod-Weinstein et al. (2009) adopt a gravitational æther
framework in which an effective cosmological constant
emerges from quantum gravity effects at BH horizons. Notably,
this yields a reduction of the quantum ﬁeld theory tuning
required, from over one hundred decimal places to only two.
Their scenario is, however, distinct from ours; it has a different
theoretical basis and does not, to our knowledge, predict that
BHs gain mass as the scale factor increases.

4.7. Validation of Preferential Growth of SMBHs

testing combinations of

Further validation of the measured preferential growth of
SMBHs by Farrah et al. (2023) is an essential test of our
proposal. This can be done by: deepening understanding of the
relevant biases, improving morphological determinations of the
high-redshift samples,
traditional
assembly pathways in simulations, and improving the accuracy
of SMBH and stellar mass measures. An important future test is
to improve the statistics and reliability of the high redshift
sample. Doing so requires assembling a sample of 103 active
galactic nuclei in elliptical hosts with low SFRs and reddenings
over 0.7 < z < 2.5. The sample should have reliable measures
of host stellar mass and consistent measures of SMBH mass
with a subset that includes multi-epoch reverberation mapped
measures. Such a study would enable narrower
redshift
intervals to be used at z > 0.7, giving ﬁner discrimination
between cosmological coupling and other processes.

Mass shifts consistent with cosmological coupling have been
proposed to exist
in the merging binary BH population,
explaining both the observed BH mass spectrum and the
existence of BHs in the pair-instability mass gap, though with a
smaller coupling strength of k ∼ 0.5 (Croker et al. 2021). A

4.8. Quasars at z > 6 and the SMBH Mass Function

The existence of SMBHs at z  6 (e.g., Trakhtenbrot et al.
2015) with masses >109Me is challenging to explain via
accretion and direct collapse models (e.g., Inayoshi et al. 2020;

6

The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 944:L31 (9pp), 2023 February 20
Volonteri et al. 2021). Cosmological coupling with k = 3,
starting at z = 25, provides a mass increase of a factor of 51 by
z = 6 (Equation (1)). This would ease tensions between BH
growth models and observations of z > 6 quasars, but it has not
been shown that cosmological coupling is required to do so.
BH masses must also increase between z ∼ 6 and z = 0 by a
factor of 343. Comparison of the BH mass function in quasars
at z ∼ 6 with that at z = 0 must be compatible with this
the Sołtan (1982)
minimum increase. Generalization of
argument to k = 3 coupling is a ﬁrst step, though comparison
of the high-end mass cutoff is not sufﬁcient, because SMBHs
may cease to accrete luminously above ∼1011Me (e.g.,
King 2015; Inayoshi & Haiman 2016; Carr et al. 2021).

5. Conclusions

=

Realistic astrophysical BH models must become cosmolo-
gical at large distance from the BH. Non-singular cosmological
BH models can couple to the expansion of the universe,
gaining mass proportional to the scale factor raised to some
power k. A recent study of SMBHs within elliptical galaxies
across ∼7 Gyr ﬁnds redshift-dependent 8–20× preferential BH
growth, relative to galaxy stellar mass. We show that this
growth excludes decoupled (k = 0) BH models at 99.98%
conﬁdence. Our measured value of k
at 90%
conﬁdence is consistent with vacuum energy interior BH
models that have been studied for over half a century.
Cosmological conservation of stress-energy implies that k = 3
BHs contribute as a dark energy species. We show that k = 3
stellar remnant BHs produce the measured value of ΩΛ within a
wide range of observationally viable cosmic star formation
histories, stellar IMFs, and remnant accretion. They remain
consistent with constraints on halo compact objects and they
naturally explain the “coincidence problem,” because dark
energy domination can only occur after cosmic dawn. Taken
together, we propose that stellar remnant k = 3 BHs are the
astrophysical origin for the late-time accelerating expansion of
the universe.

adopt the model of Madau & Fragos (2017) at z  4. Between
z = 4 and cosmic dawn at z = 25 we adopt a power law for the
SFRD with exponent α < 0, matched continuously to the z  4

(Harikane et al. 2022a; Bouwens et al. 2022; Donnan et al.

consistent with all extant data.

To account for variation in the stellar IMF with redshift, we
divide the SFRD into a Population III epoch at z > 7 (e.g.,
Inoue et al. 2014, but see Liu & Bromm 2020) and a standard
epoch, characterized by a Kroupa IMF at z  7. We consider
scenarios where the Population III epoch is characterized by
either a Kroupa IMF or the top-heavy Harikane et al. (2022a)
IMF ∝M−2.35 for 50  M  500, and zero elsewhere. Finally,
we use the redshift-dependent, mean-metallicity model of
Madau & Fragos (2017), truncated at Ze, to enable use of

seeds, so we adopt te = 20 Myr. The uncertainty in te is large,
e.g., Safarzadeh & Haiman (2020) ﬁnd Population III stellar

te and λe, we ﬁx the efﬁciency ò = 0.16, roughly 30% of the
Kerr BH limit (e.g., Bardeen 1970).

To compute viable SFRDs, we use a Monte Carlo approach.
Because high-mass remnants formed at high redshift can easily
dominate ΩΛ, care must be taken to sufﬁciently sample these
tails of the distributions. We divide the domains for IMF and
SFRD distributions into distinct windows such that, in these

Massive Compact Halo Object Constraints

Appendix B

Here we establish that a k ∼ 3 BH population sufﬁcient to
produce ΩΛ is consistent with constraints on MACHOs. In
Figure 3, we display the contribution to halo density from k = 3
BH masses at z = 0 computed in the explicit SFRD models
shown in Figure 2. Consistent with the discussion in
Section 4.1, we have assumed a uniformly dispersed population
in the computation of Figure 3. We adopt a uniform Milky Way
(MW) halo density equal to the median dark matter density at
the solar system 8.8 ± 0.5 × 10−3 Me/pc3 as measured by
Cautun et al. (2020). This is conservative relative to a mean
halo density 1.7 × 10−2 Me/pc3, inferred from 1.37 × 1011 Me
within the MW at <20 kpc as measured by Posti &
Helmi (2019).

In Figure 3 we display limits on MACHOs from microlen-
sing (e.g., Blaineau et al. 2022), wide halo binary disruption
(e.g., Monroy-Rodríguez & Allen 2014; Tyler et al. 2022), and
UFD disruption (e.g., Brandt 2016). We approximate the UFD
constraint from Brandt (2016) as ∝1/m following Binney &
Tremaine (2011, Equation (7.104)) and convert from the UFD
halo density assumed by Brandt (2016, Figure 4) to our MW
halo density scale by a multiplicative factor 0.3/0.0088.

All BH density contributions lie below the microlensing and
wide binary limits by several orders of magnitude. High
accretion models with a Kroupa IMF show some tension with
UFD constraints, which begin to have discriminatory power in
our scenario. Comparing the two top-heavy IMF models, the
effect of accretion is to redistribute mass density from the
IMBH range into the SMBH range. The top-heavy IMF with no
accretion model shows how a top-heavy IMF acts to populate
the IMBH region.
