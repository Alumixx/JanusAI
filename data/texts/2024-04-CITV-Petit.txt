Abstract

In this article, we introduce a new bimetric model designed to describe a universe in which positive and
negative masses coexist. This model is based on a M4 manifold, equipped with two Lorentzian metrics,
solutions to a system of coupled (cid:28)eld equations that we have constructed by Lagrangian derivation from
an action speci(cid:28)cally designed for this geometric context. Our approach unveils new insights into the
interactions between masses of opposite signs, proposing a new paradigm in which our model becomes a
geometric extension of General Relativity in regions dominated by negative masses, such as the vicinity
of the "Dipole Repeller". Moreover, our model converges to the Einstein (cid:28)eld equation in the limit of
weak (cid:28)elds, as is the case near the Sun, making it a natural and elegant generalization of the classical
theory. We have also developed a non-stationary, homogeneous, and isotropic exact solution, which
explains the acceleration and expansion of the universe without resorting to a cosmological constant.
The Janus model provides an explanation for the lacunar structure observed in the mass distribution in
the universe, a phenomenon illustrated by the discovery of the "Dipole Repeller". The implications of our
theory, which suggests concrete predictions such as the dimming of brightness around vast negative mass
structures, are veri(cid:28)able through observation and represent a potential advance in our understanding of
the universe.

Introduction

Here we propose a bimetric model describing a universe where positive and negative masses coexist. Particles
with non-zero positive mass move along non-zero length geodesics, while photons, with zero mass and positive
energy, follow zero-length geodesics. These two types of trajectories stem from metrics gµν and ¯gµν. These
two Lorentzian metrics, with signature (+ − −−), are de(cid:28)ned on a spacetime with a coordinate system
{x0, x1, x2, x3}. We construct the corresponding Ricci tensors Rµν and ¯Rµν, as well as the Ricci scalars R

and ¯R derived from them. In a heuristic manner1, we consider a system of (cid:28)eld equations of the form:

Rµν − 1

¯Rµν − 1
2

Rgµν = χ [Tµν + Tµν]

¯R¯gµν = κχ(cid:2) ¯Tµν + ¯Tµν

(cid:3)

We choose not to introduce cosmological constants Λ and ¯Λ. The tensors Tµν and ¯Tµν represent the
contributions to the (cid:28)eld from positive and negative masses, respectively. The tensors Tµν and ¯Tµν will be
interaction tensors, representing the action of negative masses on positive masses and the action of positive
masses on negative masses, respectively.

In our numerical simulations, we have heuristically opted for the following interaction laws:

(cid:136) Positive masses attract each other

(cid:136) Negative masses attract each other

(cid:136) Masses of opposite signs repel each other.

From a physical perspective, numerical simulations [3] indicate that in regions dominated by positive
masses, negative masses are almost nonexistent, and vice versa. Focusing on the Newtonian approximation,
in mixed notation, we express the tensors associated with the two types of matter as follows:

For negative masses to exert mutual attraction, it is necessary to choose a negative gravitational constant,

that is, to set κ = −1. Thus, we write:

µ and ¯T ν

The terms T ν

µ represent the interaction tensors. The (cid:28)rst, T ν

µ , represents the contribution of
negative masses to the (cid:28)eld experienced by positive masses, while the second, ¯T ν
µ , represents the contribution
of positive masses to the (cid:28)eld experienced by negative masses. In a region dominated by positive masses,
which primarily contribute to the (cid:28)eld, the interaction tensor T ν
µ can be neglected, thus simplifying the (cid:28)rst
equation.

The equation in question is Einstein’s equation, where the cosmological constant is set to zero. This
equation is at the origin of local phenomena predicted by general relativity, such as the perihelion precession
of Mercury and the de(cid:29)ection of light by the Sun, con(cid:28)rming that the Janus model is in agreement with

these tests of general relativity at the local scale. Moreover, in regions dominated by negative masses, the
mutual attraction they exert on each other follows from the following equation:

µ = −χ ¯T ν

Since ¯ρ < 0 and ¯p < 0, this results in an attraction. This phenomenon also a(cid:27)ects photons of negative
energy, whose trajectories are altered when they pass near a negative mass, following an attractive trajectory.

The challenge lies in determining the exact form of the interaction tensors T ν

µ and ¯T ν
µ .

2 Construction of a Non-Stationary, Homogeneous, Isotropic Exact

Solution [4]

Numerical simulations, relying on the Newtonian approximation and starting from the principle that masses
of opposite signs repel each other in a manner proportional to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance separating them, have yielded conclusive results. This leads us to
formulate the following hypothesis:

If we consider describing the behavior of the system under the assumptions of non-stationarity, isotropy,
and homogeneity, the interaction terms can be identi(cid:28)ed, for the radiative phase where pressures can be
neglected, with forms 2.1 and 2.2, where the scalars are then functions of the chronological variable x0. The
metrics then take the following FLRW forms:

gµν = dx02 − a2

¯gµν = dx02 − ¯a2

1 − ku2 + u2dθ2 + u2 sin2 θdϕ2

+ u2dθ2 + u2 sin2 θdϕ2

(cid:20) du2
(cid:20) du2

1 − ¯ku2

(cid:21)
(cid:21)

A search for solutions yields negative curvature indices k = ¯k = −1.

If we introduce these metrics into the system of equations 2.5 and 2.6, considering 2.1 and 2.2, we obtain
a classical system of four equations whose compatibility conditions require having the form 2.7 of the two
functions Φ and ϕ of the chronological variable x0:

3 CONSTRAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH STATIONARY SOLUTIONS

This then leads to an equation that is none other than that of the conservation of energy and mass.
Here, in a similar situation, the compatibility condition is a conservation of energy extended to the two
populations:

As we will see later, the mathematical consistency of the system of two (cid:28)eld equations (Bianchi conditions)
translates physically into conservation and balance equations. This leads to obtaining an exact solution in
the form of two di(cid:27)erential equations:

To be in agreement with observational data, which suggest that in this phase where the radiation pressure
is negligible, the acceleration of the expansion of the positive species is positive, the total energy of the
system must be negative [5]. With a negative curvature index, both curves tend towards asymptotes.
This situation seems more satisfactory to the physicist than the one emerging from Einstein’s equation
where this acceleration of expansion is then attributed to the cosmological constant, re(cid:29)ecting an unknown
phenomenon. As this energy density does not evolve over time, this results in exponential growth. We note
that the coe(cid:30)cients ϕ and Φ from 2.7 can respectively be identi(cid:28)ed with the factor

(cid:113) g

¯g and its inverse.

3 Constraints Associated with Stationary Solutions

In the system of coupled (cid:28)eld equations 1.1 and 1.2, the terms on the left-hand side involve the Ricci tensors
Rµν and ¯Rµν and the corresponding Ricci scalars R and ¯R. These terms are calculated from the two metrics
gµν and ¯gµν.

Using these two metrics, we then calculate the form of two operators known as covariant derivatives ∇µ
and ¯∇µ. It turns out that, due to their form, the two left-hand sides of both equations identically satisfy
the following relation:

The two tensors, Tµν and ¯Tµν, also satisfy the following condition:

We should also have:

At this stage, it can be said that it is precisely these two conditions that determine the form of these

interaction tensors. As for observational data, what is the constraint we must adhere to?

4 INTERPRETATION OF THE DIPOLE REPELLER THROUGH THE JANUS COSMOLOGICAL MODEL

Numerical simulations have shown that the two populations mutually exclude each other. If we limit
ourselves to these two extreme situations, the system of coupled (cid:28)eld equations 1.5 and 1.6 simpli(cid:28)es, when
positive mass dominates, to:

The (cid:28)rst equation 3.7 reduces to Einstein’s equation. This solution can be constructed, both in vacuum
and within masses, in which case the mathematical condition 3.3 translates into the equation established
in 1916 by Karl Schwarzschild and in 1939 by Tolman, Oppenheimer, and Volko(cid:27), known as the Tolman-
Oppenheimer-Volko(cid:27) equation [2] [6] [7]. This solution can then extend to the description of the geometry
inside a neutron star.

There is no need to explicitly detail the form of the interaction tensor, present on the right-hand side of
equation 3.8, since the physical e(cid:27)ect that ensues, the de(cid:29)ection of negative energy photons by a positive
mass, eludes observation.

When, on the contrary, negative mass dominates, the system becomes:

For equation 3.10, condition 3.4 re(cid:29)ects the balance between pressure force and gravity within a body
(cid:28)lled with negative mass matter. This yields a condition identical to the classic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volko(cid:27)
equation. The challenge then is to give a form to the interaction tensor T ν
µ in the (cid:28)rst equation 3.9 that
satis(cid:28)es condition 3.5.

Interpretation of the Dipole Repeller through the Janus Cosmo-
logical Model

When negative masses are predominant as near the Dipole Repeller ([1]), we are faced with potential obser-
vational data that will emerge sooner or later and will require a response.

Numerical simulations have shown that as soon as gravitational instability can play its role in both
populations, it is negative mass that dominates, given that negative mass density is predominant. In this
gravitational instability, we have a characteristic time, given by Jeans, which is:

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(4.1)

(4.2)

Since |¯ρ| ≫ ρ, the accretion time of negative masses is shorter.

It is therefore within this second
population that a semi-regular population of spheroidal conglomerates will establish itself. Observationally,
this will create immense voids in the positive world, hundreds of millions of light-years in diameter. In 2017,
observation con(cid:28)rmed this prediction [1]. This is the Dipole Repeller, located 600 million light-years from
our galaxy (Figure 1).

In the seven years following, other large voids of this kind have been identi(cid:28)ed. These then behave
like immense proto-stars, composed of negative-mass anti-hydrogen and anti-helium. This concentration of
matter occurs until the ionization of hydrogen, which then stops this movement. Nevertheless, the geometry

inside this spheroid falls within the framework of the Newtonian approximation, that is, when the particle
agitation velocities are much smaller than the local speed of light2 and when curvature e(cid:27)ects are negligible3.
This context also leads to the fact that pressure terms can be neglected.

We then need to propose a form of the source tensors such that the condition of zero covariant derivative

is asymptotically satis(cid:28)ed in the limit of weak (cid:28)elds4.

Hence, if we consider the impact of the presence of negative masses on the geometry of spacetime struc-
tured by the metric tensor of the (cid:28)rst (cid:28)eld equation 3.9 associated with the population of positive masses,
we can de(cid:28)ne the corresponding interaction tensor 4.3 as follows:

Thus, the impact of the pressure gradient of negative masses on the geodesics followed by ordinary
matter and positive-energy photons according to the (cid:28)eld equation 3.9 translates into the following Tolman(cid:21)

Then, it’s possible to build the Schwarzschild interior metric solution in this manner:

Where rn is the star radius, and the characteristic radius ˆr is de(cid:28)ned depending on the star’s density ρ

as follows:

We can deduce that a particle of ordinary matter will undergo a repulsive gravitational (cid:28)eld due to the

e(cid:27)ect of a distribution of negative masses.

Then, when the source of the gravitational (cid:28)eld of the second (cid:28)eld equation 3.10 is created by a negative

mass, we can freely de(cid:28)ne the following energy-momentum tensor as follows:

4 INTERPRETATION OF THE DIPOLE REPELLER THROUGH THE JANUS COSMOLOGICAL MODEL

Both solutions 4.4 and 4.10 reduces to the Euler equation approximately equal to − G ¯M (r) ¯ρ(r)

in the

r2

Newtonian limit, re(cid:29)ecting hydrostatic equilibrium5.

The form of these two source tensors satis(cid:28)es the Bianchi conditions. This would obviously not be the
case if the negative mass were to fall outside of this framework. For that, there would need to exist neutron
stars of negative mass. However, the characteristic time of evolution of conglomerates of negative mass,
their "cooling time", exceeds the age of the universe. These spheroidal conglomerates cannot evolve, so the
content of this negative spacetime will be limited to a mixture of negative mass anti-hydrogen and anti-
helium. Since nucleosynthesis cannot occur, there can be no anti-galaxies or anti-stars, regardless of their
mass. Consequently, there cannot exist anti-neutron stars.

Moreover, in the case where this negative spacetime would generate hyperdense stars through an as yet
unknown mechanism, it would then be necessary to reconsider the form of these tensors. However, the
current con(cid:28)guration satis(cid:28)es all currently available and potentially available observational data.

Photons of positive energy emitted by sources located behind the Dipole Repulsor will experience a sig-
ni(cid:28)cant decrease in their magnitude due to the negative gravitational lensing e(cid:27)ect. These photons then
freely traverse this vast void. The e(cid:27)ect will be maximal when the photons brush past this spheroidal con-
glomerate, where the entirety of the mass must be taken into account. However, it will be negligible when
these photons pass through the central neighborhood (Figure 2).

Thus, we predict that when a map is established by the JWST telescope, the invisible mass will manifest

its presence by a brightness attenuation, not over the entire disk, but in a ring.

Let us now consider the interaction between two entities: ordinary matter with positive mass interacting
with negative mass through gravitational e(cid:27)ects. This model involving negative mass takes into account the
in(cid:29)uence of both dark matter and dark energy.

We can describe this system of two entities with respective metrics gµν and ¯gµν. Let R and ¯R be the

corresponding Ricci scalars. We then consider the following two-layer action6:

four-dimensional nature of this bimetric universe. This implies considering the entire spacetime as the domain of integration,
integrating the contributions from each point to the action. The term d4x represents an in(cid:28)nitesimal element of hypervolume of
this bimetric spacetime, used to "measure" each segment during integration. Thus, it is a multiple volume integral performed
over the four dimensions of spacetime, accumulating contributions to the total action from each four-dimensional volume segment
corresponding to each metric.

6 CONCLUSION

6 Conclusion

This model sheds light on several fundamental aspects of the universe:

(cid:136) It describes the temporal evolution of the universe in its material phase, based on the assumption that
the involved mediums are isotropic and homogeneous. In this context, positive masses are accelerated.
With a negative curvature index, the model anticipates a decrease of this acceleration towards zero,
eventually leading to a linear expansion of the universe. This conclusion contrasts with predictions
stemming from the use of a cosmological constant, which suggest an asymptotic expansion.

(cid:136) It accounts for stationary states corresponding to an SO(3) symmetry, thus illustrating the model’s
ability to reproduce con(cid:28)gurations classically associated with Einstein’s equation. For an SO(2) sym-
metry, the model, like Einstein’s, only describes the geometry of empty space, where mathematical
coherence conditions are inherently respected.

(cid:136) The analysis of the exact instationary solution provided by the model reveals results in accordance

with observations, underlining its adequacy with real phenomena observed in the universe [5].

(cid:136) It predicts a patchy structure for positive mass, forming around spaces left by conglomerates of negative
mass in a spheroidal shape, arranged in a regular manner. This prediction received initial observa-
tional con(cid:28)rmation with the discovery of the Dipole Repeller in 2017 [1]. Subsequently, the detection
of numerous other cosmic voids, each extending over a hundred million light-years in diameter, further
strengthens this theory.

(cid:136) The model also predicts a decrease in the apparent magnitude of objects located behind the Dipole
Repeller in an annular region, a phenomenon applicable in the long run to all similar formations. This
attenuation is due to the e(cid:27)ect of these massive negative structures on the distribution of light in the
universe.

In summary, our model o(cid:27)ers a comprehensive understanding of phenomena classically associated with

Einstein’s equation, while providing predictions veri(cid:28)able by observation.
