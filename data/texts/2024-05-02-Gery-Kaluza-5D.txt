Abstract

In this paper, we revisit the Kaluza-Klein theory from the perspective of the classiﬁcation
of elementary particles based on the coadjoint orbit method. The keystone conjecture is to
consider the electric charge as an extra momentum on an equal footing with the mass and the
linear momentum. We study the momentum map of the corresponding symmetry group ˆG1
which conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the electric charge is not an invariant,
it depends on the reference frame, which is in contradiction with the experimental
i.e.
observations. In other words, it is not the symmetry group of the Universe today as we
know it. To avert this paradox, we scale the ﬁfth coordinate and consider the limit when the
cylinder radius 𝜔 vanishes. For the corresponding group ˆG0 also of dimension 15, the charge
is an invariant then independent of the frame of reference and the observer. On this ground,
we propose a cosmological scenario in which the elementary particles of the early Universe
are classiﬁed from the momenta of the group ˆG1, next the three former dimensions inﬂate
quickly while the ﬁfth one shrinks, leading to the 4D era in which as today the particles are
characterized by the momenta of the group ˆG0. By this mechanism, the elementary particles
can acquire electric charge as a by-product of the 4 + 1 symmetry breaking of the Universe.
This work opens the way to the geometric quantization of charged elementary particles. We
construct the corresponding ˆG0-connections by pullback on the space-time. Imposing that
the linear 5-momentum is parallel-transported, we recover the conservation of the charge and
the equation of motion with Lorentz force. We revisit the variational relativity and obtain
the ﬁeld equations for both the gravitation and electromagnetic interactions with coupling
terms which are negligible at the Newtonian approximation, allowing to recover Maxwell
equations.

Keywords: Kaluza-Klein relativity, symplectic mechanics, cosmology, coadjoint orbit

method, elementary particles, electric charge.

1 Introduction

Kaluza-Klein is an extension of general relativity to unify the gravitation and electromagnetism,
considering a Riemannian manifold of dimension 5 by completing the 4 coordinates ( 𝑋 1 , · · · , 𝑋 4)
of the space-time with an extra spacelike dimension coordinate ˆ𝑋 5 . The pioneering paper, Kaluza
[1915], started out by interpreting the 1 + 5 metric as follows1

[ ˆ𝐺 𝜇𝜈] = (cid:20) 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗

2 𝛼 𝐴 𝑗

2 𝛼 𝐴𝑖
2 𝜙

(cid:21)

where 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 is the space-time metric, 𝐴𝑖 is the electromagnetic potential, 𝜙 is a new ﬁeld, often
called dilaton, and 𝛼 is a coupling constant. Besides, Theodor Kaluza introduce the so-called
cylinder condition , i.e. the components of the metric and other tensors do not depend on the
ﬁfth coordinate. Even so, the expression of the contravariant metric ˆ𝐺 𝛼𝛽 in terms of the ˆ𝐺 𝛼𝛽
being complex, he uses the linearized weak ﬁeld approximation. The components of the Ricci
tensor read

[ ˆ𝑅𝜇𝜈] = (cid:20) 𝜕𝑘 Γ𝑘

−𝛼 𝜕𝑘 𝐹𝑘 𝑗

𝑖 𝑗 − 𝜕 𝑗 Γ𝑘

𝑖𝑘 −𝛼 𝜕𝑘 𝐹𝑘𝑖

−(cid:3) 𝜙

(cid:21)

where 𝐹𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜕𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 − 𝜕 𝑗 𝐴𝑖 is the electromagnetic ﬁeld and (cid:3) = 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗∇𝑖∇ 𝑗 . With the energy-
momentum tensor of the dust matter ˆ𝑇𝜇𝜈 = 𝜌𝑚 ˆ𝑈𝜇 ˆ𝑈𝜈 as source, Einstein ﬁeld equations extended
to 5D

allow to recover with 𝑅𝑖 𝑗 the ﬁeld equations of the gravitation exactly, Maxwell’s equations also
with ˆ𝑅𝑖5 but at the cost of an hypothesis that turned out, as remarked Einstein, to be untenable
(grossly superluminal velocity of electrons in the ﬁfth dimension). In contrast, Lorentz force
appears naturally in the equation of motion of a particle but, because of the above hypothesis,
the last term of this equation and also the equation with ˆ𝑅55 are problematic.

After Kaluza’s promising paper but suﬀering several shortcomings, another breakthrough is
the work of Oskar Klein [1926a,b] who adopts also the cylinder condition but with restrictions

on the coordinate changes to 𝑋 𝑖 = 𝐻𝑖( 𝑋′1, · · · , 𝑋′4),

ˆ𝑋 5 = ˆ𝑋′5 + ℎ( 𝑋′1, · · · , 𝑋′4) and then the

following form the metric

One of the interests of the formulation is that the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor occurs
naturally at the right hand member of the ﬁrst equation. Another interest is that the second
equation provides Maxwell equation when the dilaton 𝜙 is set to one, but if so the last equation
is satisﬁed only if the right hand member is null, i.e. under the too restrictive constraint that the
norms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are equal. In contrast, if the dilaton varies, the ﬁeld
equations have no classical interpretation. If we continue anyway to set 𝜙 to one, the equation of
geodesics reads

Owing to the cylinder condition, 𝑈5 is constant along the geodesic, hence the idea to put
𝑈4 = 𝑞/𝑚0 where 𝑞 is the electric charge and 𝑚0 the rest mass, that leads to the equation of
motion

where the right hand member is just Lorentz force.

However, the discoveries of the starting quantum mechanics suggested to Klein that the ﬁfth
dimension is curled up and microscopic. Using de Broglie wavelength 𝜆5 = ℎ/𝑝5 where ℎ is
Planck constant and 𝑝5 is the linear momentum in the ﬁfth dimension, Klein found that the size
𝑙𝐾 of the space along the ﬁfth dimension was about 10−30 cm, very small with respect to the
nuclear dimension (of the order of 10−13 cm) and thereby gave an explanation for the cylinder
condition in this small value. For a comparison between Kaluza and Klein approaches, Sewards
[2008] can be consulted. Classical theory was completed in the 1940s and the full ﬁeld equations
including the scalar ﬁeld were obtained almost simultaneously (Thiry [1948a,b], Jordan [1948],
Scherrer [1949]).

Albert Einstein’s position with respect to Kaluza-Klein theory has changed during his scien-
tiﬁc career. In Einstein [1920], when giving his inaugural lecture in Leyden, Einstein for the ﬁrst
time publicly commented positively on this uniﬁcation program. However, in a letter to H. Weyl
[1922], he regrets that it cannot produce non-singular rotation symmetric particle solutions.
Later on, his work with W. Mayer [1931] is a a ﬁrst attempt to propose an uniﬁed ﬁeld theory.
Commenting their work, ´E. Cartan [1934] interprets the torsion of the 5D space as the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. The last Einstein’s works on the topics are in collaboration with P. Bergmann
[1938] and later on with P. Bergmann and V. Bargmann [1941]. For more details, the reader is
referred to van Dongen [2000].

Despite of the astonishing breakthrough of the Kaluza-Klein theory (emergence of Lorentz
force, Maxwell equations and electromagnetic energy stress tensor from the general relativity),
often qualiﬁed of ”Kaluza miracles”, it suﬀers of several serious shortfalls not yet rectiﬁed.
Nonetheless this theory has given rise to many developments that it is not possible to cite all. We
are focused on the topics relevant to the issues dealt with in the present paper.

In the modern language of diﬀerential geometry, Oskar Klein’s construction is formalized
as a principal 𝑈(1)-bundle. The electromagnetic potential of covariant components 𝐴𝑖 can be
interpreted as a connection 1-form valued in the Lie algebra of the group. From the viewpoint of
the physics of elementary particles, a relevant generalization of the Kaluza-Klein theory consists

3

in substituting an arbitrary non-abelian group 𝐺 for 𝑈(1). The connection 1-form has coordinates
𝐴𝑎
𝑗 and the curvature form in a coordinate frame is

1

𝐹 𝑎

𝑖 𝑗 =

2 (𝜕𝑖 𝐴𝑎

𝑗 − 𝜕 𝑗 𝐴𝑎

𝑖 ) + 𝐶 𝑎

𝑏𝑐 𝐴𝑏

𝑖 𝐴𝑐

𝑗

where 𝐶 𝑎
𝑏𝑐 are the structure constants of the group 𝐺. It must contain at least a 𝑈(1) subgroup for
the conservation of the electric charge and a 𝑆𝑈(2) subgroup for the conservation of the isospin
(Kerner [1981]).

Initially introduced by Bargmann [1954] to solve cohomologic diﬃculties to construct group
actions on quantum wave functions in the Galilean setting, the Lie group that is named after
him acts on a 5D space of which the ﬁfth coordinate has the physical meaning of a speciﬁc
action (in the sense of Hamilton least action principle), then it has not to be confused with
Kaluza-Klein space. Bargmannian geometric structures have been studies by several authors
(Duval et al. [1985, 1991], de Saxc´e and Vall´ee [2010, 2016], Cardall [2024]). Despite of the
diﬀerences with Kaluza-Klein theory, some aspects of the Bargmannian approach were a source
of inspiration for this work.

Another issue which has grasped researcher attention is the Kaluza-Klein cosmology. A gen-

eralized Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker metric in 5D were introduced by Chodos and Detweiler
[1980]. The idea is that while the ﬁfth dimension has been shrinking, the other three spatial di-
mensions have been expanding, that could explain the large ratio of the electromagnetic to gravita-
tional forces as a consequence of the age of the Universe, in agreement with Dirac’s large-number
hypothesis. Sahdev [1984] obtained improved solutions of the ﬁeld equations with perfect ﬂuids
added on the right-hand side and found that this scenario can oﬀer a resolution to the horizon
problem. However, instead of stabilizing at some small but ﬁnite value, as any reasonable physics
would require, the internal radius in the ﬁfth dimension tended to zero. Other models attempt-
ing to stabilize asymptotically the internal radius were proposed by Matzner and Mezzacappa
[1985], Copeland and Toms [1985], Okada [1986], Giorgini and Kerner [1988]. These inter-
esting works did not necessarily receive the welcome they deserved, perhaps because they were
based on the theory of Kaluza-Klein whose weaknesses were known.

Finally, not developed from Kaluza-Klein theory but playing a key role in this work, we have
to point out Jean-Marie Souriau’s seminal work in which he proposed for the classical description
of an elementary particle to study a family of homogeneous spaces for a symmetry group, the
coadjoint orbits, and to classify them (Souriau [1970, 1997b]). On this ground, he introduced
the geometric prequantization in Souriau [1966]. As Kaluza-Klein theory is based on an 𝑈(1)-
principal bundle of which the base manifold is the space-time, the key idea of the prequantization
is to work with a 𝑈(1)-principal bundle of which the base space is a symplectic manifold, a
coadjoint orbit of the structure group. A tentative to combine this method with the 5D approach
to treat the mass and the electric charge on an equal footing is proposed by ´Sniatycki [1980] but,
in contrast to Kaluza-Klein theory, the ﬁfth dimension is timelike without physical justiﬁcation.
The reader not familiar with this topic can consult, in addition to Souriau’s references previously
cited, Kostant [1970] who is with Souriau one of the pioneers of this method, Kijowski [1977]
and Woodhouse [1991].

The paper is structured as follows.
Sections 2 and 3 cover the background material needed to tackle the core of the paper as
well as to deﬁne the terminology and notations. The reader familiar with one or several of these
topics can skim through them. Section 2 is devoted to Euclidean spaces, pointing out adjoint
maps, Hodge star operator and a generalization of the vector product to arbitrary dimension. In
Section 3, we recall useful main results of symplectic mechanics, namely the coadjoint orbit
method and the momentum map. The Section 4 is a brief reminder of the application of this
method to Poincar´e group allowing to classify the elementary particles in relativity.

After these preliminaries, the main body of the paper is a trilogy: classiﬁcation of the particles

in Kaluza-Klein theory, pullback connection on the space-time, extended variational relativity.

In Section 5, we apply the coadjoint orbit method to the symmetry group of Kaluza-Klein 5D
space, denoted ˆG1, which conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the linear momentum
along the ﬁfth dimension, interpreted as the electric charge, is not preserved by the group, then
depends on the reference frame, contradicting the observations. The aim of Section 6 is to avert
this paradox by using the fact that the ﬁfth dimension is microscopic. The result of the zoom in
is to reveal a new symmetry group denoted ˆG0 for which the charge is invariant. Section 7 begin
with the presentation of a cosmological scenario in which the particles in the early 5D Universe
are classiﬁed according to the group ˆG1 and, after a transition phase in which the three former
spatial dimensions inﬂate quickly while the ﬁfth one shrinks, the particles in the 4D era are
classiﬁed thanks to ˆG0. By this mechanism, the elementary particles can acquire electric charge
as a by-product of the 4 + 1 symmetry breaking of the Universe. Next, we apply the coadjoint
orbit method to the group ˆG𝜔 for the transition between ˆG1 and ˆG0. In 5D, we generalize the
spin polarisation in the form of a plane.

The second part of the trilogy is developed in Section 8. Our aim is to construct the ˆG0-
connections on the frame principal bundle. As the zoom out leads to a singularity in the ﬁfth
dimension, we build on the space-time a pullback connection. We claim that the motion of a
charged particle and the evolution of its charge are such that its linear 5-momentum is parallel-
transported. The torsion free condition allows to show that the charge is conserved along the
trajectory and we recover the Lorentz force.

The trilogy ends with Section 9 where we revisit Palatini variational relativity by adding
to the ten potentials of the metric the four electromagnetic potentials. The generalized action
depends on the matter and the connection representing both the gravitation and electromagnetic
interactions. We discuss the ﬁeld equations with coupling terms between the two interactions.
At the Newtonian approximation, the coupling is weak and we recover Maxwell equations.

2 Euclidean spaces

The two former subsection are simple reminder to deﬁne the terminology and notations used in
the paper.

2.1 Metric

An Euclidean space T of dimension 𝑛 is a vector space equipped with a (covariant) metric G,
i.e. a nondegenerate 2-covariant tensor G

∀U ∈ T ,

G(U , V ) = 0 ⇔ V = 0 .

The value of the metric tensor for U and V is called their scalar product and denoted U · V . Let
(e𝑖) be a basis of T . The symmetric regular matrix 𝐺 gathering the components 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 = e𝑖 · e 𝑗
is called Gram’s matrix. Thus, it holds:

G(U , V ) = U · V = 𝑈𝑇 𝐺 𝑉 ,

where 𝑈 and 𝑉 are the columns gathering respectively the components of U and V . If 𝐺 is
diagonal with element +1 or −1 on the diagonal, the basis is called orthonormal. The number 𝑝
of positive number on the diagonal is called the positive index of inertia. If 𝑛 ≥ 2 and 𝑝 = 1,
the space is said hyperbolic. To every vector U is associated one and only one linear form
V ↦→ G(U , V ) denoted U∗. The covariant components of U∗ depends on the contravariant
components of U through the operation of lowering the index: 𝑈𝑖 = 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗𝑈 𝑗 . The elements 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗
of the inverse 𝐺−1 of Gram’s matrix are the components of a 2-contravariant tensor G−1 called
contravariant metric, hence the reverse operation of raising the index: 𝑈𝑖 = 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗𝑈 𝑗 .

2.2 Adjoint of a linear map

Let A be a linear map from an Euclidean space T0 into another one T . Its adjoint (with respect
to the scalar products) is the linear map A∗ from T into T0 such that:

∀U ∈ T , ∀V ∈ T0,

U · (A V ) = (A∗U) · V .

If A is represented by the matrix 𝐴 in bases of T0 and T , A∗ is represented by:

𝐴∗ = 𝐺−1

0 𝐴𝑇 𝐺 .

We verify that:

(A + A′)∗ = A∗ + A′∗,

(A B)∗ = B∗A∗,

(A∗)∗ = A .

In particular, if T0 = R, the linear map U : R → T : 𝜆 ↦→ 𝜆 U can be identiﬁed to the vector U
and U∗ is the unique linear form associated to U with respect to the metric since (1) degenerates
into

which is the matrix form of index lowering. Then the scalar product of two vectors reads:

U · V = 𝑈∗ 𝑉 . Another particular case of interest is when T0 = T then (1) reads:

𝑈∗ = 𝑈𝑇 𝐺

𝐴∗ = 𝐺−1 𝐴𝑇 𝐺

(1)

(2)

(3)

We verify that 𝑇 𝑟(A∗) = 𝑇 𝑟(A). The linear map is self-adjoint (resp. anti-self-adjoint or

skew-adjoint) if:

A = A∗

(resp. A = −A∗) .

2.3 Vector product

We consider an oriented Euclidean space T of dimension 𝑛, i.e.
𝑣𝑜𝑙(e1, . . . , e𝑞) the (𝑛 − 𝑞)-form such that

𝑣𝑜𝑙 ∈ Ó𝑛 T ∗ such that 𝑣𝑜𝑙(e1, . . . , e𝑛) = 1 for every orthonormal basis (e𝑖). We denote

there exists a volume form

(𝑣𝑜𝑙(e1, . . . , e𝑞))(e𝑞+1, . . . , e𝑛) = 𝑣𝑜𝑙(e1, . . . , e𝑞, e𝑞+1, . . . , e𝑛)

We call vector product of (𝑛 − 1) vectors V1, . . . , V𝑛−1 the vector J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−1) such that

J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−1)∗U = 𝑣𝑜𝑙(V1, . . . , V𝑛−1, U)

In Souriau [1965, §26.B], it is proved that

Theorem 2.1 (Souriau) Properties of the vector product:

♦ J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−1) ≠ 0 if and only if V1, . . . , V𝑛−1 are linearly independent
♥ J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−1) is orthogonal to every argument V𝑖 of J
♠ The linear map J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−2) : T → T : V ↦→ J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−2, V ) is one-to-one

and skew-adjoint

Denoting 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑖1 ...𝑖𝑛 the covariant components of the volume form of an oriented Euclidean
𝑟 the 𝑖-th component of the vector V𝑟 , the 𝑗 -th component of the

space of dimension 𝑛 and 𝑉 𝑖
vector product is given by

(J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−1)) 𝑗 = Õ𝑖1...𝑖𝑛−1

𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑖1 ...𝑖𝑛−1

where we rise the last index of the volume form with the metric. The element of the matrix
J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−2) at the intersection of the 𝑗 -th row and the 𝑘-th column is
1 . . . 𝑉 𝑖𝑛−2
𝑛−2

(J (V1, . . . , V𝑛−2)) 𝑗

𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑖1 ...𝑖𝑛−2 𝑘

Now, we would like to obtain a recursive formula to calculate the vector product when we

𝑘

= Õ𝑖1...𝑖𝑛−1
add an extra dimension. If 𝑉 , 𝑉𝑖 ∈ T = R𝑛 , we put
𝑣 (cid:21) , ˆ𝑉𝑖 = (cid:20) 𝑉𝑖

𝑣𝑖 (cid:21) ∈ ˆT = R𝑛+1

ˆ𝑉 = (cid:20) 𝑉
(−1)𝑛−𝑘+1 𝑣 𝑘 J (𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑘−1, 𝑉𝑘+1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛)∗, 𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛)#∗

(4)

Then, it can be proved that

ˆJ ( ˆ𝑉1, . . . , ˆ𝑉𝑛) = " 𝑛Õ𝑘=1

In the particular case of the classical positive Euclidean space of dimension 3 (𝑛 = 𝑞 = 3),
we use the notation 𝑗 instead of J and we recover the cross product 𝑗(𝑢, 𝑣) = 𝑢 × 𝑣 and the

7

linear map 𝑢 ↦→ 𝑗(𝑢) is one-to-one from R3 into the space of 3 × 3 skew-symmetric matrices.
In the sequel, the notation J will be reserved to the dimension 4 and ˆJ to the dimension 5. In
R4 equipped with the metric of Gram’s matrix 𝐺 = 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔(1, −1, −1, −1), the vector product of 3
vectors

itemizes as

from which we deduce

In R5 equipped with the metric of Gram’s matrix ˆ𝐺 = 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔(1, −1, −1, −1, −𝜔2), let us consider

2.4 Hodge operator
Let us consider the oriented Euclidean space T = R𝑛 of positive index of inertia 𝑝. Owing (2),
the skew-adjoint map 𝑀 can be identiﬁed to the 2-form 𝐴𝑀 through

Then 𝑀 = J (𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛−2) can be identiﬁed to the 2-form 𝐴𝑀 = −𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛−2). The

𝑈∗ 𝑀 𝑉 = 𝑈𝑇 𝐴𝑀𝑉 = 𝐴𝑀(𝑈, 𝑉) with 𝐴𝑀 = 𝐺 𝑀

The adjoint2 of a 𝑞-form 𝐴 is the (𝑛 − 𝑞)-form ∗𝐴 such that

(∗𝐴)(𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛−𝑞) = (−1)𝑞 (𝑛−𝑞) 𝐺 𝑞( 𝐴, 𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛−𝑞))

The linear map ∗ :Ó𝑞 T →Ó𝑛−𝑞 T : 𝐴 ↦→ ∗𝐴 is called Hodge operator. The following result

can be proved:

2To do not confuse with the adjoint of a linear map.

Theorem 2.2 Properties of the Hodge operator:

♦ 𝑀 = J (𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛−2) is identiﬁed to the 2-form

𝐴𝑀 = ∗(𝑉∗1 ∧ . . . ∧ 𝑉∗𝑛−2) = −𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉𝑛−2)

♥ If 𝐴 is a 𝑞-form, ∗(∗𝐴) = (−1)𝑞(𝑛−1)+𝑛− 𝑝 𝐴

♮ ∗(𝑉∗ ∧ 𝑈∗) = −𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝑈, 𝑉)
In the special case of interest : 𝑛 = 4, 𝑞 = 2, if 𝐴𝑀 is a 2-form, ∗𝐴𝑀 is also a 2-form identiﬁed
to an skew-adjoint map denoted ∗𝑀. If 𝑉∗1 ∧ 𝑉∗2 = 𝐴′𝑀 , then 𝑀′ = 𝐺−1(𝑉∗1 ⊗ 𝑉∗2 − 𝑉∗2 ⊗ 𝑉∗1) =
𝑉1𝑉∗2 − 𝑉2𝑉∗1 . On the other hand, ♦ reads 𝐴J(𝑉1,𝑉2) = ∗𝐴′𝑀 = 𝐴∗𝑀′ then:

that implies, owing to ♥

∗(𝑉1𝑉∗2 − 𝑉2𝑉∗1) = J (𝑉1, 𝑉2)

∗J (𝑉1, 𝑉2) = (−1)𝑛− 𝑝(𝑉1𝑉∗2 − 𝑉2𝑉∗1)

3 Coadjoint orbit method to classify the elementary particles

This Section is a simple reminder of concepts of symplectic mechanics. For more details on
this topics, the reader can consult for instance Souriau [1970], Abraham and Marsden [1978],
Guillemin and Sternberg [1984], Libermann and Marle [1987], Souriau [1997b]. In the sequel,
all the considered Lie groups are matrix groups. Any Lie group 𝐺 left linearly acts on its Lie
algebra 𝔤 by the adjoint representation

𝐴𝑑 (𝑎) : 𝔤 → 𝔤 : 𝑍′ ↦→ 𝑍 = 𝑎𝑍′𝑎−1

𝐺 left linearly acts on the dual 𝔤∗ of 𝔤 by the coadjoint representation 𝐴𝑑∗ such that

∀𝑍 ∈ 𝔤,∀𝜇 ∈ 𝔤∗,

( 𝐴𝑑∗(𝑎) 𝜇) (𝑍) = 𝜇(cid:16) 𝐴𝑑(cid:16)𝑎−1(cid:17) 𝑍(cid:17)

Let (M, 𝜛) be a symplectic manifold, a symplectic action of a Lie group 𝐺

𝐺 × M → M : (𝑎, 𝑥) ↦→ 𝑥′ = 𝑎 · 𝑥

of a Lie group 𝐺 on M

𝐿∗𝑎𝜛 = 𝜛

and a momentum mapping 𝜓 : M → 𝔤∗

∀𝑍 ∈ 𝔤, ∀𝑑𝑥 ∈ 𝑇𝑥M, 𝜛 (𝑍 · 𝑥, 𝑑𝑥) = −𝑑 (𝜓 (𝑥) 𝑍)

If the manifold M is connected, two momentum mappings diﬀer by a constant. All the symplectic
manifolds considered in the sequel are assumed to be connected. We consider now 𝔤∗ as equipped

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

with the associated structure of aﬃne space. The momentum mappings belong to the aﬃne space

of the mappings from M into 𝔤∗, called the momentum mapping space. Any element 𝐴 of the
aﬃne group GA (𝔤∗) of 𝔤∗ is of the form 𝐴 (𝜇) = 𝑃𝜇 + 𝜇0 where 𝑃 ∈ GL (𝔤∗) and 𝜇0 ∈ 𝔤∗. The
action of 𝐺 on M induces a smooth right action on the momentum mapping space

∀𝑥 ∈ M, ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐺,

(𝜓 · 𝑎) (𝑥) = 𝜓 (𝑎 · 𝑥)

Theorem 3.1 (Souriau) Let (M, 𝜛) be a connected symplectic manifold and a symplectic action
(𝑎, 𝑥) ↦→ 𝑥′ = 𝑎 · 𝑥 of a Lie group 𝐺. Then, the induced action (𝑎, 𝜓) ↦→ 𝜓′ = 𝜓 · 𝑎 has the form

𝜓 · 𝑎 = 𝐴𝑑∗ (𝑎) 𝜓 + 𝑐𝑜𝑐𝑠 (𝑎)

(12)

where 𝑐𝑜𝑐𝑠 (𝑎) does not depends on 𝑥. The mapping 𝑐𝑜𝑐𝑠 : 𝐺 → 𝔤∗ is called a symplectic

cocycle.

The demonstration can be found for instance in Souriau [1970, 1997b, Theorem (11.34)] and
[Abraham and Marsden , 1978, Section 4.2]. In the sequel, we consider only symmetry groups
for which the consideration of symplectic cocycles is not relevant, then the group acts linearly.

The symplectic structure of the coadjoint orbits is revealed by the following result.

Theorem 3.2 (Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau) Let 𝐺 be a Lie group and an orbit of the coadjoint
representation 𝑜𝑟 𝑏 (𝜇) ⊂ 𝔤∗. Then:

♦ The inclusion map 𝑜𝑟 𝑏 (𝜇) → 𝔤∗ is a regular embedding. A vector 𝑑𝜇 ∈ 𝑇𝜇𝔤∗ is tangent

to the orbit if there exists 𝑍𝑑 ∈ 𝔤 such that:

𝑑 𝜇 = 𝜇 ◦ 𝑎𝑑 (𝑍𝑑) = −𝑎𝑑∗(𝑍𝑑) 𝜇

♥ The orbit 𝑜𝑟 𝑏 (𝜇) is a symplectic manifold of which the symplectic form is deﬁned by:

𝜛𝐾 𝐾 𝑆(𝑑𝜇, 𝛿𝜇) = 𝜇 [𝑍𝑑, 𝑍 𝛿]

The dimension of the orbit is even.

♠ 𝐺 is a symplectic group and any 𝜇 ∈ 𝔤∗ is its own momentum.

The reader can ﬁnd a demonstration in Souriau [1970, 1997b, Theorem (11.34)].

In physical terms, every observer is working in a reference frame. The symmetries 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺
are changes of reference frames or, equivalently, of observers. According to the mechanistic
description of elementary particles proposed by Souriau, an isolated dynamical system is said
to be elementary when the symmetry group acts transitively on the space of its motions, i.e.
it is the set of all possible motions of the system. The momentum map of its action is then a
symplectic diﬀeomorphism of this space onto a coadjoint orbit of the group. For him, the so
deﬁned elementary systems are mathematical models for elementary particles of physicists.

4 Elementary particles in Poincar´e relativity

In special relativity, the Universe U is represented by a 4D space3. An event X ∈ U occuring
in a reference frame at time 𝑡 and position 𝑥 ∈ R3 is represented by its coordinates

U is equipped with the Minkowski 1 + 3 metric represented in an orthonormal basis by Gram’s
matrix

then in this basis the speed of the light 𝑐 is equal to 1. The Lorentz transformations are the linear
transformations 𝑃 of R4 which conserve the 1 + 3 metric, then such

In terms of the boost (or velocity of transport) 𝑣 ∈ R3 and a rotation 𝑅 ∈ SO(3), using the factor
𝛾 = 1/p1− k 𝑣 k2, the structure of a Lorentz transformation is

𝑃 = " 𝛾

In the sequel, we consider only the special Lorentz transformations i.e.

that belong to the

connected component of the identity SO+(1, 3), a Lie group of dimension 10. The Poincar´e
group G is the set of aﬃne transformations of R4

of which the linear part 𝑃 is a Lorentz transformation and that we denote 𝑎 = (𝐶, 𝑃). The
translation is decomposed into a clock change 𝜏 and a space translation 𝑘

G is a Lie group of dimension 10. The elements of its Lie algebra 𝔤 are characterized by

𝑍 ∈ 𝔤 ⇔ 𝑍 = 𝛿𝑎 = (𝛿𝐶, 𝛿𝑃) such that 𝛿𝑃 is skew-adjoint

then

𝛿𝐶 = (cid:20) 𝛿𝜏
𝛿𝑘 (cid:21) ,

𝛿𝑃 = (cid:20) 0

elementary particles.

𝜇 ∈ 𝔤∗ ⇔ 𝜇 = (Π, 𝑀) such that 𝑀 is skew-adjoint

𝑀 = (cid:20) 0 𝑟𝑇

where 𝑚 ∈ R is the mass (equal to the energy because 𝑐 = 1), 𝑝, 𝑟, 𝑙 ∈ R3 are respectively the
linear momentum, the passage and the angular momentum. Then (16) itemizes into

The coadjoint representation reads

𝜇(𝑍) = 𝑙 · 𝛿𝜃 − 𝑟 · 𝛿𝑣 + 𝑝 · 𝛿𝑘 − 𝑚 𝛿𝜏

𝜇 = 𝐴𝑑(𝑎) 𝜇′ ⇔ Π = 𝑃 Π′, 𝑀 = 𝑃 𝑀′𝑃∗ + 𝐶 (𝑃 Π′)∗ − (𝑃 Π′) 𝐶∗

(18)

In Souriau [1970, 1997b, Chapter 3, §14], Souriau uses the type (timelike or lightlike) of the
4-momentum vector (or energy-momentum vector) Π for a classiﬁcation of elementary systems.
By these means, he obtains a large part of the physicists’ classiﬁcation of elementary particles.
Below, brieﬂy summarized, his results are presented.

Let us suppose that Π is timelike and deﬁne the spin momentum

from which we deduce of (18) its transformation law

𝑀0 = 𝑀 + Π 𝑋∗ − 𝑋 Π∗

𝑀0 = 𝑃 𝑀′0𝑃∗

and two properties

(a) 𝑀0 is skew-adjoint
(b) The set of 𝑋 ∈ R4 such that 𝑀0 Π = 0 is a straight line D parallel to Π
Owing to (20), 𝑀0 does not depends on 𝑋 when 𝑋 runs over D. Taking into account that a non
null vector orthogonal to a timelike vector is spacelike (see Souriau [1965, §28]), 𝐼, 𝐽 ∈ R4 such
that
(21)

𝐼∗ 𝐼 = 1,

𝐽∗ 𝐼 = 0

Π = 𝑚0 𝐼,

𝐽∗𝐽 = −1,

On this ground, we put

𝑀0 = 𝑠 J (𝐼, 𝐽)

verifying the properties (a) and (b) because of Theorem 2.1 ♥ and ♠. The momentum 𝜇 = (Π, 𝑀)
is characterized by D and 𝐽 or, equivalently, by 𝑋, 𝐼, 𝐽. Owing to (8), we have

∗𝑀 = ∗𝑀0 + ∗( 𝑋 Π∗ − Π 𝑋∗) = ∗𝑀0 + J ( 𝑋, Π)

Let us introduce the polarization

𝑊 = (∗𝑀) Π
Then, taking into account Theorem 2.1 ♥, (22) and (9)

𝑊 = (∗𝑀0) Π + J ( 𝑋, Π) Π = 𝑠 𝑚0 (∗J( 𝑋, Π)) 𝐼 = 𝑠 𝑚0 (𝐽 𝐼∗ − 𝐼 𝐽∗) 𝐼

or, taking into account (21)

𝑊 = 𝑠 𝑚0 𝐽

The straight line of direction 𝐽 is called the polarization line.

A particle with spin is characterized by two non vanishing 4-vectors, its energy-momentum

Π (timelike) and its polarization 𝑊 (spacelike). The two numbers (Casimirs)

𝐶2 = Π∗Π > 0,

𝐶4 = 𝑊∗𝑊 < 0

are invariant of the orbit, then do not depend on the reference frame or the observer. The calculus
of the dimension of the isotropy group of the momentum 𝜇 shows that they are only 2 independent
invariants, then every invariant is a combinations of the Casimirs. The numbers

are interpreted as the rest mass and the spin of the particle. In particular, let

𝑚0 = √Π∗Π,

𝑠 =

√−𝑊∗𝑊
√Π∗Π

Π′ = (cid:20) 𝑚0

0

(cid:21)

be the 4-momentum in the comoving frame (or proper reference frame). Applying to it a boost
𝑣, i.e. a Lorentz transformation (4) where the rotation is the identity, we obtain by (18) the mass
and the linear momentum in the reference frame of any observer

This relation can be expressed also as

𝑚 = 𝑚0𝛾,

𝑝 = 𝑚0𝛾 𝑣

Π = 𝑚0 𝑈 such that 𝑈∗𝑈 = 1

It is worth to remark that the straight line D is the trajectory of the particle Souriau [1970,
1997b, Chapter 3, §14]. If it is parameterized by the arc length 𝑠 (for the metric 𝐺), 𝑈 is the
4-velocity

They are two other kind of orbits characterizing a particle without spin and a massless
particle. For more details the reader is referred to Souriau [1970, 1997b, (14.24) and (14.29)].
We know that elementary particles are characterized by their mass, spin and electric charge.
This last property is missing from this formalism and is usually reintroduced in the particle
description as an external element to the geometric approach (see Souriau [1970, 1997b, Chapter
3, §15]). Our aim now is to develop a paradigm compatible with the experimental observations
and in which the charge naturally appears as a momentum by constructing a bridge between the
coadjoint orbit method and the Kaluza-Klein theory.

5 Elementary particles in Kaluza-Klein relativity

In this theory, the Universe ˆU is represented by a 5D hyperbolic Euclidean space where the ﬁfth
ˆX ∈ ˆU occuring in a reference frame at time

dimension is curled up and microscopic. An event

ˆU is equipped with a 1 + 4 metric represented in an orthonormal basis by Gram’s matrix

(26)

where 𝐺 is given by (13). The set ˆG1 of aﬃne transformations ˆ𝑎 = ( ˆ𝐶, ˆ𝑃) of R5 of which the

linear part conserves the metric

is a Lie group of dimension 15. The structure of the transformations of ˆG1 is given by

ˆ𝐶 = (cid:20) 𝐶

ˆ𝑃 = (cid:20) 𝑃

(27)

Its restriction to R4 is Poincar´e’s group. The elements of its Lie algebra ˆ𝔤1 are characterized by

ˆ𝑍 ∈ ˆ𝔤1 ⇔ ˆ𝑍 = 𝛿 ˆ𝑎 = (𝛿 ˆ𝐶, 𝛿 ˆ𝑃) such that 𝛿 ˆ𝑃 is skew-adjoint

where

then

𝛿 ˆ𝑃 = (cid:20) 𝛿𝑃

where 𝛿𝑃 is skew-adjoint with respect to the metric (13).

Following Souriau, the momenta of the elementary particles can be obtained by considering

the group action on the coadjoint orbits. The momenta ˆ𝜇 of ˆG1 are of the form

characterized by

ˆ𝜇 ∈ ˆ𝔤∗1 ⇔ ˆ𝜇 = ( ˆΠ, ˆ𝑀) such that

ˆ𝑀 is skew-adjoint

For convenience, we decompose the momenta as follows

ˆΠ = (cid:20) Π
𝑞 (cid:21) ,

ˆ𝑀 = (cid:20) 𝑀 𝑄
𝑄∗ 0 (cid:21)

where the scalar 𝑞 and 𝑄 ∈ R4 are extra momenta with respect to those of Poincar´e’s group. The
natural conjecture is to identify 𝑞 to the electric charge with suitable physical units. This idea
is mentioned in Petit and D’Agostini [2014] but the extension of Poincar´e’s group proposed by
the authors is only a subgroup of ˆG1 of dimension 11. In the present work, the aim is to perform
an in-depth investigation by examining the consequences of this conjecture to verify if they ﬁt
the observations.

Then (28) itemizes into

ˆ𝜇( ˆ𝑍) = −Π∗𝛿𝐶 −

𝑇 𝑟( 𝑀 𝛿𝑃) − 𝑞 𝛿𝜉 − 𝑄∗𝛿𝑏

1

2

The coadjoint representation reads

ˆ𝜇 = 𝐴𝑑( ˆ𝑎)∗ ˆ𝜇′ ⇔ ˆΠ = ˆ𝑃 ˆΠ′,

ˆ𝑀 = ˆ𝑃 ˆ𝑀′ ˆ𝑃∗ + ˆ𝐶 ( ˆ𝑃 ˆΠ′)∗ − ( ˆ𝑃 ˆΠ′) ˆ𝐶∗

The action of ˆG1 on the energy-momentum-charge vector ˆΠ itemizes into

Π = 𝑃 Π′ + 𝑞′ 𝛽 𝑃∗−1𝑏,

𝑞 = 𝑏∗Π + 𝛽 𝑞′

It results that the electric charge is dependent on the reference frame then on the observer, totally
at odds with the experimental observations. Likewise for Poincar´e’s group, we assume that ˆΠ is
timelike. The only invariant is

ˆΠ∗ ˆΠ = Π∗Π − 𝑞2 > 0

The value of the charge depends on the observer and may even be zero in certain reference
frames. The charge is not characteristic only of the particle. Author’s opinion is that ˆG1 is not
the symmetry group of the Universe today as we know it but nonetheless must not be a priori
rejected. We have only to ﬁnd the Physics that could admit it as symmetry group. However
before to discuss this point, our goal now is to ﬁnd a more appropriate symmetry group for the
Physics today. It is what we shall be going to see in the next Section. Latter, we shall come back
to the analysis of the structure of the momenta ˆ𝜇 of ˆG1 and the exhaustive determination of the
invariants of the motion.

6 Elementary particles in an Universe with a microscopic ﬁfth di-

mension

6.1 Zoom in

with the scaling

To avert the previous paradox concerning the electric charge, it is worth to remark that the ﬁfth
dimension is curled up and the estimate of the cylinder radius (about 10−30 cm) is overwhelmingly
small with respect to usual lengths in nuclear physics. The idea is to take advantage of this fact
by a zoom in along the ﬁfth coordinate and to consider the limit when the cylinder radius 𝜔
vanishes. Then we consider the transformation law of a vector ˆV

ˆ𝑉′ = ˆ𝑃−1

𝜔

ˆ𝑃 𝜔 = (cid:20) 1R4

𝜔 (cid:21)

ˆ𝐺′ = ˆ𝑃𝑇
𝜔

ˆ𝐺 ˆ𝑃 𝜔

in such way that if the length was of the order of the cylinder radius in the ﬁfth coordinate,
it is after scaling of the order of the unity in the new coordinate (with a prime). Owing to the
transformation law of 2-covariant tensors,

the metric and its inverse are represented after the scaling by

Next we omit the primes and consider the limits of these two matrices when 𝜔 → 0

ˆ𝐺′ = (cid:20) 𝐺 0

The ﬁrst matrix represents a covariant semi-metric of signature (+ − − − 0) while the second
one represents a contravariant semi-metric of signature (0 0 0 0−). After scaling, the Euclidean
ˆU is canceled but it remains two debris, a symmetric 2-covariant tensor that we

denote ˆG0 represented by ˆ𝐺 0 and a symmetric 2-contravariant tensor or, equivalently, a vector
𝛀0 represented by the column

components of

ˆG0 and 𝛀0 is such that

where 𝜉 is a scalar, 𝐶, 𝑏 ∈ R4 and 𝑃 is a Lorentz transformation. As ˆG1, it is a Lie group of

6.2 Gauge transformation

To understand the meaning of 𝑏, we change of point of view and work in the framework of the gen-

eral relativity in which ˆV is a tangent vector to a the 5D manifold ˆU. As in de Saxc´e and Vall´ee

[2016], we hope to determine whether the G-structure in Kobayashi sense (Kobayashi [1972])
is integrable by solving thanks to Frobenius method the PDE system

For ˆG1, the manifold ˆU is Riemannian and the the ˆG1-structure is not integrable if
ˆU is curved.
If it is ﬂat, the transition maps are of the form ˆ𝑋′ ↦→ ˆ𝑋 = ˆ𝐶 + ˆ𝑃 ˆ𝑋′. For ˆG0, the compatibility

conditions of the system provides the equation

where 𝑋′ ↦→ ℎ( 𝑋′) is a real function, that by integration leads to the gauge transformation

The ˆG0-structure is integrable only if the manifold is ﬂat. Otherwise, it is convenient as in
Souriau [1964, Chapter VII, (41.21)] to consider the transition maps of standard charts

The momenta ˆ𝜇 of ˆG0 are of the form

Π = 𝑃 (Π′ − 𝑞′ 𝑏)

𝑞 = 𝑞′

𝑄 = 𝑃 𝑄′ + 𝑞′𝐶

𝑄 = 𝑞 𝑋

The coadjoint representation ˆ𝜇 = 𝐴𝑑( ˆ𝑎)∗ ˆ𝜇′ is deﬁned by the following transformation laws

𝑀 = 𝑃 𝑀′𝑃∗ + 𝐶 (𝑃 (Π′ − 𝑞 𝑏))∗ − (𝑃 (Π′ − 𝑞 𝑏)) ˆ𝐶∗ + (𝑃 𝑏)(𝑃 𝑄′)∗ − (𝑃 𝑄′)(𝑃 𝑏)∗

In contrast to what happened with ˆG1, the electric charge is independent on the reference
frame then on the observer. This include in particular the invariance with respect to the gauge
transformation. Besides, owing to (38), the transformation law (43) is satisﬁed if we claim that

that provides the physical interpretation of the momentum 𝑄 as the product of the charge
and the space-time position. We suggest to call it the 4-position-charge momentum. Let us
remark also that, taking into account the transformation law of Π, the one of 𝑀 is simpliﬁed as
follow

𝑀 = 𝑃 𝑀′𝑃∗ + 𝐶 Π∗ − Π ˆ𝐶∗ + (𝑃 𝑏)(𝑃 𝑄′)∗ − (𝑃 𝑄′)(𝑃 𝑏)∗

To calculate the number of independent invariants of the momentum of a group 𝐺, we

determine the isotropy group of ˆ𝜇 from which we deduce the dimension of the coadjoint orbit

The number of independent invariant of the orbit is

dim (orb( ˆ𝜇)) = dim𝐺 − dim(iso( ˆ𝜇))

𝑛𝐼 = dim 𝔤 − dim(orb( ˆ𝜇)) = dim(iso( ˆ𝜇))

Taking into account (40), (45 and (43), to determine the isotropy group of ˆ𝜇, we need to solve
with respect to the unknowns 𝐶, 𝑃, 𝑏, 𝜉 the system of equations

𝑀 = 𝑃 𝑀 𝑃∗ + 𝐶 (𝑃 (Π − 𝑞 𝑏))∗ − (𝑃 (Π − 𝑞 𝑏)) ˆ𝐶∗ + (𝑃 𝑏)(𝑃 𝑄)∗ − (𝑃 𝑄)(𝑃 𝑏)∗

the condition (42) being useless because the charge is an obvious invariant.

For a charged particle (𝑞 ≠ 0), let us show that the number of independent invariants is

3. Indeed, (46) and (48) give

1

𝑏 =

𝑞 (Π − 𝑃∗Π), 𝐶 =

1
𝑞 (𝑄 − 𝑃 𝑄)

Introducing these expressions of 𝑏 and 𝐶 into (47) leads to

𝑄 = 𝑃 𝑄′ + 𝑞′𝐶

can be interpreted as the spin momentum, by comparison to (19). As in Poincar´e relativity,
the straight line D of equation 𝑀0 Π = 0 is the trajectory of the particle, parallel to Π given by,
owing to (24) and (25)

Π = 𝑚0 𝑈 with 𝑈 =

(52)

𝑑𝑋
𝑑𝑠

First we consider a charged particle with spin (𝑞 ≠ 0, Π timelike, 𝑀0 ≠ 0). Equation (50)
being non linear with respect to 𝑃 then diﬃcult to solve, we use an inﬁnitesimal method by
working with its diﬀerential version in terms of Lie algebra. Diﬀerentiating it with respect to 𝑃
at the identity and taking into account that 𝛿𝑃 is skew-adjoint, it holds

𝛿𝑃 𝑀0 − 𝑀0𝛿𝑃 = 0

𝛿𝑃 = (cid:20) 0

𝛿𝑣𝑇

𝑗(𝛿𝜃) (cid:21) ,

𝑀0 = (cid:20) 0

𝑟0

𝑟𝑇
0

𝑗(𝑙0) (cid:21)

Putting

we obtain the system of equation

𝑙0 × 𝛿 𝑣 + 𝑟0 × 𝛿 𝜃 = 0,
In the general case (𝑙0 × 𝑟0 ≠ 0), the solution is
𝛿 𝜃 = 𝜆 𝑟0 + 𝜇 𝑙0,

𝑟0 × 𝛿 𝑣 − 𝑙0 × 𝛿 𝜃 = 0

𝛿 𝑣 = 𝜇 𝑟0 − 𝜆 𝑙0

where 𝜆 and 𝜇 are two independent scalars of arbitrary values. Then the dimension of the
isotropy group of 𝑀0 is 2 because the couple (𝛿 𝜃, 𝛿 𝑣) then 𝛿 𝑃 is deﬁned by these 2 independent
parameters. It is easy to verify that the dimension 2 is also valid for the particular case. The
value of 𝑏 and 𝐶 are ﬁxed by (49). The value of 𝜉 that does not occurs in the equations is free.
Then the dimension of the isotropy group of ˆ𝜇 and then the number of independent invariants is
3.

For a charged particle with spin, a set of 3 independent invariants of ˆ𝜇 is the electric

charge, the rest mass and the spin of the particle

𝑞,

𝑚0 = √Π∗Π,

𝑠 =

√−𝑊∗𝑊
√Π∗Π

where the polarization 𝑊 is deﬁned by (23).

For a charged particle without spin (𝑞 ≠ 0, Π timelike, 𝑀0 = 0), equation (50) is satisﬁed
for every 𝑃. The number independent invariants is 7. The invariants are 𝑞 and the 6 independent
components of 𝑀0 which are null.

19

For a particle without charge (𝑞 = 0, 𝑄 = 0), the coadjoint representation of ˆG0 is reduced

to (18) and we recover the classiﬁcation of elementary particles in Poincar´e’s relativity.

To author’s knowledge, the Physics of the symmetry group ˆG0 has not been considered in
the literature. By the way, there exists a group introduced by L´evy-Leblond [1965] and called
by him Carroll’s group4, of which the elements have the same mathematical structure as the
ones of ˆG0. However the physical meaning of Carroll’s group is very diﬀerent from the one of
ˆG0: Carroll’s group linearly acts on a space of dimension 4 (not 5) and the dimension analogous
to the ﬁfth of ˆG0 is timelike (not spacelike). Carroll’s group was constructed as a degeneracy
of Poincar´e’s group (similar but distinct from Galileo’s group). Despite of these discrepancies
concerning the physical aspects, Carroll’s group may be considered as a forunner of the group
ˆG0. For more details on Carroll’s group, the reader is referred to Duval et al.
[1985, 1991,
2014], Bergshoeﬀ et al. [2014, 2023], L´evy-Leblond [2023].

7 A cosmological scenario for the evolution of elementary particle

structure

One of the important problems in Kaluza-Klein theories is how to explain the large separation
of the scale of our 3D space and that of the extra dimension. This issue was addressed in Okada
[1986] with a Robertson-Walker metric in our four dimensions and a 𝑑-dimensional sphere 𝑆𝑑
in the extra dimensions. For our concern, 𝑑 = 1. Under certain assumptions, this approach
predicts stable cosmological models for the extra dimension and, using Kasner solutions for
approximations when 𝑡 → 0, a possible evolution of the scale factors 𝑎 for our 3D space and 𝜔
for the ﬁfth dimension given by

𝑎(𝑡) (cid:27) 𝑎0 𝑡1/2,

𝜔(𝑡) (cid:27) 𝜔0 𝑡−1/6

Although the assumptions are aﬀected by many uncertainties, it seems reasonable to expect a
cosmological scenario in which:

• the elementary particles of the early 5D Universe are classiﬁed from the momenta of the

group ˆG1,

the group ˆG0.

By this mechanism, the elementary particles can acquire electric charge as a by-product of
the 4 + 1 symmetry breaking of the Universe.

To describe it, we consider the metric ˆG𝜔 at scale 𝜔. We omit the prime for the scaled

coordinates. Owing to (34), the metric is represented by Gram’s matrix

the creation of this group.

The set ˆG𝜔 of aﬃne transformations ˆ𝑎 = ( ˆ𝐶, ˆ𝑃) of R5 of which the linear part conserves the
metric ˆ𝐺 𝜔 is a Lie group of dimension 15. The structure of the transformations of ˆG𝜔 is given

When 𝜔 = 0, we recover the group ˆG0. We would like to classify the elementary particles with
charge at scale 𝜔 > 0. In particular, we shall obtain the classiﬁcation for the early Universe
(𝜔 = 1) of which the study was only sketched out in Section 5. The other limit case of the
Universe today (𝜔 = 0) that is singular was already studied in Section 6.
The elements ˆ𝑎 = (𝛿 ˆ𝐶, 𝛿 ˆ𝑃) of the Lie algebra ˆ𝔤𝜔 of ˆG𝜔 are such that

where 𝛿𝑃 is skew-adjoint with respect to the metric (13). The momenta ˆ𝜇 of ˆG𝜔 are of the form

7.1 Polarization plane and map

At this stage, it is worth to remark an important diﬀerence between Poincar´e relativity, in which
𝐴𝑀0 and its adjoint ∗𝐴𝑀0 are both 2-forms, and Kaluza-Klein one for which 𝐴 ˆ𝑀0
is a 3-form
while ∗𝐴 ˆ𝑀0
is a 2-form, that has important consequences from the geometrical and physical
viewpoints. Owing to (60), ˆ𝑀0 does not depends on ˆ𝑋 when ˆ𝑋 varies over ˆD. Let ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2 ∈ R5

such that

(61)

(62)

ˆΠ = 𝑚0 ˆ𝐼,

ˆ𝐼∗ ˆ𝐼 = 1,

ˆ𝐽∗1

ˆ𝐽1 = ˆ𝐽∗2

ˆ𝐽2 = −1,

ˆ𝐽∗1

ˆ𝐼 = ˆ𝐽∗2

ˆ𝐼 = ˆ𝐽∗1

ˆ𝐽2 = 0

Over

ˆD, we put

ˆ𝑀0 = 𝑠 J ( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2)

verifying the properties (i) and (ii) because of Theorem 2.1 ♥ and ♠. The momentum ˆ𝜇 = ( ˆΠ, ˆ𝑀)
is characterized by D and ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2 or, equivalently, by ˆ𝑋, ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2. In Poincar´e relativity, there is a
polarization straight line of direction 𝐽 while in Kaluza-Klein relativity, there is a polarization
plane spanned by the couple ( ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2) that is one of its orthonormal basis. Owing to Theorem 2.2
♮, we have

∗𝐴 ˆ𝑀 = ∗𝐴 ˆ𝑀0 + ∗( ˆ𝑋∗ ∧ ˆΠ∗) = ∗𝐴 ˆ𝑀0 + 𝑣𝑜𝑙( ˆΠ, ˆ𝑋)

Then

∗𝐴 ˆ𝑀( ˆΠ, ˆ𝐽𝑘) = ∗𝐴 ˆ𝑀0( ˆΠ, ˆ𝐽𝑘) + 𝑣𝑜𝑙( ˆΠ, ˆ𝑋, ˆΠ, ˆ𝐽𝑘) = 𝑠 ∗ 𝐴 ˆΩ( ˆΠ, ˆ𝐽𝑘)

(𝑘 = 1, 2)

that leads to investigate the properties of the 2-form ∗𝐴 ˆΩ. Applying Theorem 2.1 ♥ and ♠, its
adjoint is the 3-form

from which we deduce

∗𝐴 ˆΩ = − ∗ 𝑣𝑜𝑙( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2) = − ˆ𝐼∗ ∧ ˆ𝐽∗1 ∧ ˆ𝐽∗2

ˆ𝐽1 = −(∗𝐴 ˆΩ( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽2))∗,

ˆ𝐽2 = (∗𝐴 ˆΩ( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1))∗

(63)

In terms of the momentum ˆ𝜇 = ( ˆΠ, ˆ𝑀), introducing the polarization map
pol ˆ𝜇 : R5 → R5 : ˆ𝑈 ↦→ ˆ𝑉 = pol ˆ𝜇( ˆ𝑈) = (∗𝐴 ˆ𝑀( ˆΠ, ˆ𝑈))∗

the relations (63) are recast as

𝑠 𝑚0 ˆ𝐽1 = −pol ˆ𝜇( ˆ𝐽2),

𝑠 𝑚0 ˆ𝐽2 = pol ˆ𝜇( ˆ𝐽1)

Now, we have to address the issues of the existence and (non) uniqueness of the orthonormal

basis ( ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2) to deﬁne the polarization map:

• Existence. Let us ˆ𝐾1, ˆ𝐾2 two vectors of R5 that form with ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2 an orthonormal basis

of R5 in which we decompose any vector

ˆ𝑈 = 𝜆 ˆ𝐼 + 𝜇1 ˆ𝐽1 + 𝜇2 ˆ𝐽2 + 𝜈1 ˆ𝐾1 + 𝜈2 ˆ𝐾2

22

Then

pol ˆ𝜇( ˆ𝑈) = 𝑠 𝑚0 (𝜇1 ˆ𝐽2 − 𝜇2 ˆ𝐽1)

that shows the image of the polarization map pol ˆ𝜇 is the polarization plane P. This gives
a method to determine a basis of P. We span R5 and apply the polarization map to ﬁnd
two linearly independent vectors. They form a basis of P. Then we ﬁnd an orthonormal
basis by using the Gram–Schmidt process.

• Non uniqueness. Let ( ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2) and ( ˆ𝐽′1, ˆ𝐽′2) be two orthonormal bases such that

J ( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2) = J ( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽′1, ˆ𝐽′2)

Owing to Theorem 2.1 ♥,

J ( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2) ˆ𝐽′𝑘 = J ( ˆ𝐼, ˆ𝐽′1, ˆ𝐽′2) ˆ𝐽′𝑘 = 0

(𝑘 = 1, 2)

then ˆ𝐽′1 and ˆ𝐽′2 are linear combinations of ˆ𝐽1 and ˆ𝐽2. This ensures the uniqueness of the
polarization plane. In contrast, the orthonormal basis ( ˆ𝐽1, ˆ𝐽2) is deﬁned only modulo an
orthogonal transformation of P

7.2 Invariants of the motion

For a charged particle (𝑞 ≠ 0), let us verify on a simple case that the number of independent
invariants is 2. Taking into account (31), we determine the isotropy group of the momentum by
solving the system of equations

ˆΠ = 𝑃 ˆΠ,

ˆ𝑀 = ˆ𝑃 ˆ𝑀 ˆ𝑃∗ + ˆ𝐶 ( ˆ𝑃 ˆΠ)∗ − ( ˆ𝑃 ˆΠ) ˆ𝐶∗

with respect to ˆ𝑎 = ( ˆ𝐶, ˆ𝑃). Like in Section 6.3, we diﬀerentiate these equations with respect to
ˆ𝑀 is skew-adjoint, that leads to solve the linear
ˆ𝑎 at the identity and we take into account that
system

𝛿 ˆ𝑃 ˆΠ = 0,

𝛿 ˆ𝑃 ˆ𝑀 − ˆ𝑀 𝛿 ˆ𝑃 + 𝛿 ˆ𝐶 ˆΠ∗ − ˆΠ 𝛿 ˆ𝐶∗ = 0

(64)

with respect to 𝛿 ˆ𝑎 = (𝛿 ˆ𝐶, 𝛿 ˆ𝑃). Let us pick up

that satisfy conditions (61). Owing to (54) and (55), the ﬁrst equation of (64) itemizes into

Taking into account (66), the solution of this system of equation is of the form

where 𝛼, 𝛽 are two scalars of arbitrary values. Then the dimension of the isotropy group of
the momentum then the number of its independent invariant is 2. We can take as independent
invariants the rest mass and the spin

𝑠 = q−(pol ˆ𝜇( ˆ𝐽1))∗pol ˆ𝜇( ˆ𝐽1)
p ˆΠ∗ ˆΠp−( ˆ𝐽1)∗ ˆ𝐽1

It is worth to remark that the electric charge is the linear momentum along the ﬁfth dimension
but is not an invariant of the motion in the early Universe.

8 Constructing the connection associated to the group ˆG0

At every symmetry group 𝐺 is attached a family of covariant derivatives of which the connection
matrices are deﬁned on the 𝐺-principal bundle of the 𝐺-frames and valued in its Lie algebra 𝔤
(see for instance Kobayashi and Nomizu [1963]). We call them 𝐺-connections. For the group
ˆG1, we recover the Levi-Civita free torsion connection used in Kaluza-Klein theory. A key-point
of interest is to determine the ˆG0-connections, the diﬃculty being that the manifold ˆU is not

Riemannian, and to use it to deduce the equation of motion of a particle in gravitation and
electromagnetic ﬁelds.

24

8.1 Zoom out

It is time now to restore the primes canceled for convenience in Section 6.1 after the zoom
ˆG0 and 𝛀0 are represented at the
in. For instance, according to (35) and (36), the two tensors
microscopic scale respectively by

ˆ𝐺′0 = (cid:20) 𝐺′0 0
0 (cid:21) ,

0

ˆΩ′0 = (cid:20) 0
1 (cid:21)

with the new notation for the matrix (13)

(68)

(69)

At ﬁrst glance, we could think to come back to the macroscopic scale by zooming out with

the inverse transformation law of (32)

𝐺′0 = (cid:20) 1 0

0 −1R3 (cid:21)

ˆ𝑉 = ˆ𝑃 𝜔 ˆ𝑉′

where ˆ𝑃 𝜔 is given by (33), that leads to the singularity ˆ𝑉 5 = 0 when 𝜔 → 0.

8.2 Hypotheses on the pullback connection

In order to avert the singularity resulting from the zoom out without to lose the relevant infor-

mation in the ﬁfth dimension, we propose to pullback over the space-time U the ˆG0-connection
ˆ∇ on the tangent bundle 𝑇 ˆU. They are an inﬁnite number of ˆG0-connections. The purpose here

is not to study their properties in generic terms and to classify them. We are interested only by
those which satisfy certain physical requirements on the ground of hypotheses considered below,
(H1) to (H4) on the underlying geometric structure of the Universe and (H5) on the motion of a
charged elementary particle in both the gravitation and electromagnetic ﬁelds.

(H2) 𝜋 :

(H1) the space-time U is a Riemannian manifold. The metric G is represented in an or-
thonormal basis (e′1, · · · , e′4) of 𝑇XU by the matrix 𝐺′0 of (69) of the Minkowski metric.
ˆU → U is a principal 𝑈(1)-bundle of ﬁbers isomorphic to the unitary group
𝑈(1) = (cid:8)𝑧 = 𝑒𝑖 𝑡 , 0 ≤ 𝑡 < 2 𝜋(cid:9). The vector ﬂow 𝑡 ↦→ ˆX = 𝑒𝑖 𝑡 ·
ˆX0 is generated by the
ˆU over X. We say that a basis
vector ﬁeld ˆX ↦→ ˆ𝛀0( ˆX). Let
ˆU is a ﬁbered basis if the set of e𝑖 = (𝑇 𝜋) ˆe𝑖 for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 4 is a basis of
( ˆe1, ·, ˆe5) of 𝑇 ˆX
𝑇XU and ˆe5 is tangent to the ﬁber ((𝑇 𝜋) ˆe5 = 0).
Let us consider the ﬁbered basis ( ˆe′𝛼) = ( ˆe′1, · · · , ˆe′4, ˆ𝛀0) of 𝑇 ˆX

ˆU such as (e′1, · · · , e′4) is

ˆX a point of the ﬁber of

an orthonormal basis as for (H1). The pullback of the metric

is a ﬁeld of symmetric 2-covariant tensors (but not a metric!). ( ˆe′𝛼) is a ˆG0-basis, i.e. a
basis in which ˆG0 and 𝛀0 are represented by (68).

ˆG0 = 𝜋∗G

25

(H3)

ˆU, i.e. the bundle
ˆ∇ is a ˆG0-connection. Let 𝜋 : F ( ˆU) → ˆU be the frame bundle of
ˆU. A moving frame is a smooth section
whose ﬁber over ˆX is the set of all basis of 𝑇 ˆX
ˆX ↦→ ( ˆe′𝛼) of F . It is called a coordinate frame (or natural frame) if locally the basis is
associated to a coordinate system (or local chart) ( ˆ𝑋 𝛼) and if so it is denoted ( ˆ∂𝛼). The
of ˆG0-bases is called ˆG0-structure. It is a subbundle of F ( ˆU) and a principal
set F ˆG0
ˆG0-bundle that is endowed with an Ehresmann connection. A ˆG0-connection ˆ∇ is deﬁned
by the ﬁeld of 𝔤0-valued connection 1-form ( ˆe′𝛼) ↦→ ˆΓ′ on F ˆG0

such that

ˆ∇ ˆe′𝛼 = ˆΓ′𝛽

𝛼 ˆe′𝛽

ˆΓ′ = (cid:20) Γ′

Γ′5 0 (cid:21)

0

According to (39), the value of the connection 1-form is the 5 × 5 matrix

(70)

where Γ′ is a 4 × 4 matrix of 1-forms, skew-adjoint with respect to the metric (69), Γ′5 is
a 4-row of 1-forms and the last column of ˆΓ′ vanishes. Because ˆ𝐺′0 and ˆΩ′0 are constant in
a moving ˆG0-frame ˆX ↦→ ( ˆe′𝑎), we have
𝑑 ˆ𝐺′0 = 0,

𝑑 ˆΩ′0 = 0

Otherwise, these conditions must be replaced by

the connection ˆ∇ preserving the pullback ˆG0 of the space-time metric and the vector ˆΩ0

ˆ∇ ˆ𝐺 0 = 0,

ˆ∇ ˆΩ0 = 0

ˆ∇ ˆG0 = 0,

ˆ∇ ˆΩ0 = 0

(H4) Let 𝑓 be a section of the principal 𝑈(1)-bundle ˆU, then G = 𝑓 ∗ ˆG0. The pullback bundle
𝑓 ∗ 𝑇 ˆU is a bundle over U of which the ﬁber over X ∈ U is ( 𝑓 ∗ 𝑇 ˆU)X = 𝑇 𝑓 (X)
ˆU.
For any section ˆW of 𝑇 ˆU, the pullback section is 𝑓 ∗ ˆW = ˆW ◦ 𝑓 . The space-time is
endowed with the pullback connection 𝑓 ∗ ˆ∇, determined uniquely by

( 𝑓 ∗ ˆ∇)U ( 𝑓 ∗ ˆW) = 𝑓 ∗( ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 )U ˆW)

and torsion free, then for all smooth ﬁelds X ↦→ U , X ↦→ V of tangent vectors to the
space-time U

ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 ) U (𝑇 𝑓 )V − ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 ) V (𝑇 𝑓 )U − (𝑇 𝑓 ) [U , V ] = 0

ˆU → U is an embedding of U into ˆU. The subspace

A basis adapted to the section 𝑓 is a ﬁbered basis ( ˆe1, ·, ˆe5) such that ( ˆe1, ·, ˆe4) is a basis

ˆUX and a basis (e1, ·, e4) of 𝑇XU. Then, with the convention that Greek indices
ﬁber
run from 1 to 5 and Latin ones run from 1 to 4, ( ˆe1, ·, ˆe4, ˆe5) = ((𝑇 𝑓 )e1, ·, (𝑇 𝑓 ) ˆe4, ˆe5) is
a basis adapted to the section 𝑓 and

U = 𝑈𝑖e𝑖 ⇔ (𝑇 𝑓 )U = 𝑈𝑖 ˆe𝑖

In terms of the dual bases, on has

e𝑖(U) = ˆe𝑖((𝑇 𝑓 )U) = 𝑈𝑖,

ˆe5((𝑇 𝑓 )U) = 0

Using Christoﬀel’s symbols, the elements of the connection 1-form in this basis are

represents a linear form ˆ𝚷 that we call linear 5-momentum. Let 𝑠 ↦→ X(𝑠) be the
trajectory of a particle in the space-time, parameterized by the arc length 𝑠 (for the metric
G) and

is the unit tangent vector such that U∗U = 1. We claim that the motion of a charged
particle and the evolution of its charge 𝑠 ↦→ 𝑞(𝑠) are such that its linear 5-momentum
is parallel-transported

8.3 Explicit form of the connection and the equation of motion

Our goal now is to determine explicitly the connection satisfying the hypotheses (H3) to (H5).
As we know, the ˆG0-structure F ˆG0
is in general non integrable. Then, instead of the moving
frame ( ˆe′1, · · · , ˆe′5) of (H3), section of F ˆG0
, we would like to work with a coordinate frame
(∂1, · · · , ∂4) associated to a coordinate system ( 𝑋 1, · · · , 𝑋 4) of the space-time U and the
corresponding ﬁbered frame ( ˆe1, · · · , ˆe5) adapted to the section 𝑓 , such as ˆe𝛼 = (𝑇 𝑓 )∂𝛼 and
obtained by the change of basis

where 𝑃 is a 4 × 4 matrix, 𝐴 is a 4-column. For ˆ𝑃 being regular, 𝑃 must be regular. As the
moving frames occurring in (78) are pulled back on the space-time U, 𝑃 and 𝐴 are functions
of the coordinates 𝑋 = ( 𝑋 1, · · · , 𝑋 4). Owing to (68), the pullback ˆG = 𝜋∗G of the metric is

represented in the new frame by

also a function of 𝑋 (but does not depends on 𝑋 5). In the new frame, the connection matrix is
given by

which, taking into account (70), leads to

𝐺 Γ𝑖 = 𝑃𝑇 𝐺′0Γ′(𝑃𝑖) 𝑃 + 𝑃𝑇 𝐺′0𝜕𝑖 𝑃

where 𝜕𝑖 is the partial derivative with respect to 𝑋 𝑖. Owing to (80), we have

As Γ′ is skew-adjoint with respect to the metric (69), the ﬁrst term of the right hand member is
skew-symmetric. Then

𝐺 Γ𝑖 + (𝐺 Γ𝑖)𝑇 = 𝑃𝑇 𝐺′0𝜕𝑖 𝑃 + 𝜕𝑖 𝑃𝑇 𝐺′0𝑃 = 𝜕𝑖𝐺

Π∗ = 𝑚0 𝑈∗ − 2 𝑞 𝐴∗

ˆ∇𝑈 ˆΠ = ¤ˆΠ − ˆΠ ˆΓ(𝑈)

where ¤ˆΠ is the derivative of ˆΠ with respect to the arc length 𝑠 that is the proper time of the
particle because 𝑐 = 1.

According to hypothesis (H5), (77), (86) and (87) lead to

∇𝑈 Π∗ − 𝑞 (Γ′5(𝑃 𝑈) 𝑃 − 2 ∇𝑈 𝐴∗) = 0

As expected, according to the experience, the electric charge 𝑞 is an integral of the motion.
Then, using (88), (89) reads

∀𝑚0 ≠ 0, ∀𝑞, ∀𝑈 such that 𝑈∗𝑈 = 1,

∇𝑈(𝑚0 𝑈∗) − 𝑞 Γ′5(𝑃 𝑈) 𝑃 = 0

¤𝑞 = 0

Right multiplying by 𝑈 gives

∀𝑚0 ≠ 0, ∀𝑈 such that 𝑈∗𝑈 = 1,

¤𝑚0 𝑈∗ + 𝑚0 ∇𝑈𝑈∗ = 0

∀𝑚0 ≠ 0, ∀𝑈 such that 𝑈∗𝑈 = 1,

¤𝑚0 + 𝑚0 (∇𝑈𝑈∗) 𝑈 = 0

but as 𝑈∗𝑈 = 1 and ∇𝑈𝐺 = 0, we have

then (∇𝑈𝑈)∗𝑈 vanishes and, consequently

(∇𝑈𝑈)∗𝑈 = (∇𝑈𝑈∗) 𝑈 = −𝑈∗(∇𝑈𝑈) = −(∇𝑈𝑈)∗𝑈

that entails

(∇𝑈𝑈∗) 𝑈 = 0

¤𝑚0 = 0

(92)

As expected, according to the experience, the rest mass 𝑚0 is an integral of the motion5.
Besides, (91) is reduced to

∀𝑚0 ≠ 0, ∀𝑞, ∀𝑈 such that 𝑈∗𝑈 = 1,

𝑚0 ∇𝑈𝑈∗ − 𝑞 Γ′5(𝑃 𝑈) 𝑃 = 0

(93)

Owing to (92), right multiplying by 𝑈 gives for 𝑞 ≠ 0

The bilinear form

is such that 𝜑(𝑈, 𝑈) = 0 for all 𝑈 then it is skew-symmetric. There exists a 4 × 4 matrix 𝐹 such
as

𝐹𝑇 = −𝐹

𝜑(𝑈, 𝑉) = 𝑈𝑇 𝐹 𝑉 ,

Γ′5(𝑃 𝑈) 𝑃 = 𝑈𝑇 𝐹

(94)

Moreover, (87) becomes

The 𝑗 -th component of this 4-row is

Γ′5(𝑃 𝑈) 𝑃 𝑈 = 0

𝜑(𝑈, 𝑉) = Γ′5(𝑃 𝑈) 𝑃 𝑉

Γ5(𝑈) = 𝑈𝑇 𝐹 − 2 ∇𝑈 𝐴∗

𝑗 (𝑈) = 𝑈 𝑘 𝐹𝑘 𝑗 − 2 ∇𝑈 𝐴 𝑗

that gives rise, (𝑒𝑖) being the canonical basis of R4, to the corresponding Christoﬀel’s symbols
(95)

Γ5
𝑖 𝑗 = Γ5

𝑗 (𝑒𝑖) = 𝛿𝑘

𝑖 𝐹𝑘 𝑗 − 2 ∇𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 = 𝐹𝑖 𝑗 − 2 ∇𝑖 𝐴 𝑗

5However, it is possible to extend the formalism to a particle with time-varying mass by introducing a thrust force

as in de Saxc´e and Vall´ee [2016]

The torsion free condition (74) gives

𝑖 𝑗 − Γ5

𝑗𝑖 = 𝐹𝑖 𝑗 − 𝐹 𝑗𝑖 − 2 (∇𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 − ∇ 𝑗 𝐴𝑖) = 2 [𝐹𝑖 𝑗 − (∇𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 − ∇ 𝑗 𝐴𝑖)] = 0

(96)

where, because of the torsion free condition (84)

∇𝑖 𝐴 𝑗−∇ 𝑗 𝐴𝑖 =(cid:16)𝜕𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 − Γ𝑘

𝑖 𝑗 𝐴𝑘(cid:17)−(cid:16)𝜕 𝑗 𝐴𝑖 − Γ𝑘

𝑗𝑖 𝐴𝑘(cid:17) =(cid:0)𝜕𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 − 𝜕 𝑗 𝐴𝑖(cid:1)−(Γ𝑘

Then the skew-symmetric 4 × 4 matrix 𝐹 of elements

𝑗𝑖−Γ𝑘

represents a skew-symmetric 2-covariant tensor (or 2-form) F and, owing to (94), the equation
(93) becomes

by transposition and left multiplication by 𝐺−1, we obtain the equation of motion

(97)

(98)

where the skew-adjoint matrix

represents a 1-covariant and 1-contravariant tensor ¯F of components 𝐹 𝑖

tation is that the vector A of which the adjoint A∗ is represented by the row 𝐴∗ is the electro-
¯F ) is the 2-covariant (resp. 1 contravariant and 1-covariant)
magnetic 4-potential, F (resp.
electromagnetic ﬁeld 6 and

is the Lorentz force, represented by the right hand side of (98). We recover the equation of
motion of a charged particle in the gravitation and electromagnetic ﬁelds that ﬁts the observations
today. It deserves to remember that the equation (77) itemizes into a group of two equations, the
former one being the previous equation of motion and the later one (90) being the conservation
of the charge

The condition (97) means that the 2-form F is the exterior derivative of the 1-form A∗. The
4-potential A and its adjoint A∗ being represented respectively by

where

𝐸 = −𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 𝜙 − 𝜕𝑡 A,

𝐵 = 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑙 A

(99)

where 𝜕𝑡 is the partial derivative to the time. Owing to (25), the Lorentz force f is represented
by

𝑓 = −𝑞 ¯𝐹 𝑈 = 𝛾 𝑞 (cid:20) 𝐸 · 𝑣

𝐸 + 𝑣 × 𝐵 (cid:21)

Remark 1. The equation (98) is the usual form of the equation of motion as found in the
literature. It has been obtained by a suitable choice of adapted bases but it is not the most general
form according to the covariant equation (77). Of course, it is possible to make other choices but
it is not necessarily interesting.

Remark 2. It can be veriﬁed that, as expected, the connection ˆ∇ preserves in the adapted

bases the pullback ˆG0 of the space-time metric and the vector ˆ𝛀0

ˆ∇ ˆ𝐺 0 = 0,

ˆ∇ ˆΩ0 = 𝑑 ˆΩ0 + ˆΓ ˆΩ0 = 0

For ˆG0, it results from (83) while for ˆ𝛀0 it is a consequence of (81) and

ˆΩ0 = (cid:20) 0
1 (cid:21)

ˆ𝐺′ = (cid:20) 𝐺′0 0
−1 (cid:21)

0

∂𝛼 = ˆ𝑃𝛽

𝛼 ˆe′𝛽

resulting from (68) and (79).

Remark 3. it remains some freedom in the deﬁnition of the electromagnetic potential. For
instance, we could have erased the factor 1/2 before 𝐴∗ in the deﬁnition (79) but in this case we
should have replaced 𝑞 by −𝑞/2 everywhere. Both variants are conventional. We kept the one
we considered the most convenient.
In a ˆG1-basis

It is worth now to revisit the original Kaluza-Klein theory.

Remark 4.

( ˆe′1, · · · , ˆe′5), the metric is represented by

As in general the Riemannian structures are non integrable, we consider a coordinate frame

(∂1, · · · , ∂5) associated to a coordinate system ( 𝑋 1, · · · , 𝑋 5) of the 5 dimensional universe ˆU

obtained by the change of basis

with the transformation matrix (79). The metric is represented in the new frame by

−1
where 𝐺 given by (80). Using classical tensor notation, it holds

ˆ𝐺 = ˆ𝑃𝑇 ˆ𝐺′ ˆ𝑃 = (cid:20) 𝐺 − 4 𝐴∗𝑇 𝐴∗ 2 𝐴∗𝑇

2 𝐴∗

(cid:21)

[ ˆ𝐺 𝛼𝛽] = (cid:20)

ˆ𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 − 4 𝐴𝑖 𝐴 𝑗
ˆ𝐺 5𝑖 = 2 𝐴𝑖

ˆ𝐺 𝑗5 = 2 𝐴 𝑗
ˆ𝐺 55 = −1

(cid:21)

32

If the expression stands out the standard presentation of the metric in Kaluza-Klein theory, it
is matter of conventions. The factor 2 before 𝐴𝑖 and 𝐴 𝑗 , and −4 before 𝐴𝑖 𝐴 𝑗 result from the
deﬁnition of 𝐴∗. We explained these things in the previous remark . The negative value of ˆ𝐺 55
is consistent with the choice of the signature (+ − − − −). Restoring the positive value consists
in adopting the signature (− + + + +).
Calculating the connection matrix, we have to take care that both 𝐺 and 𝐴∗ are ﬁelds deﬁned
on ˆU, then functions of the ﬁve coordinates ˆ𝑋 1, · · · , ˆ𝑋 5, giving up Kaluza’s ”cylinder condition”.
Let 𝑠 ↦→ ˆX(𝑠) be the trajectory of a particle in the space-time, parameterized by the arc
length 𝑠 (for the metric ˆG) and

is the unit tangent vector such that ˆU∗ ˆU = 1. We claim that the motion of a particle is such
that its linear 5-momentum is parallel-transported

(100)

ˆU =

𝑑 ˆX
𝑑𝑠

ˆ𝚷 = 0

ˆ∇ ˆU

The linear 5-momentum is represented in the ˆG1-basis by the 5-row

with 𝑞′ = 𝑚0𝑈′5 and in the coordinate basis by

ˆΠ′ = [𝑚0 𝑈′∗𝑃, 𝑞′]

ˆΠ = [𝑚0 𝑈∗ − 2 𝑞 𝐴∗, 𝑞]

with 𝑈∗ = 𝑈′∗𝑃 and 𝑞 = 𝑚0𝑈5. Hence the trajectory of the particle is not a geodesic of the
manifold.

Remark 5. Finally, it is worth to remark that, although the choice (79) of ˆ𝑃 is not general,
it is suﬃcient to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the connection in terms of the ﬁelds
𝐺 and 𝐴∗ thanks to the free torsion condition. On the other hand, this choice depends on the
section 𝑓 . It is what we are going to discuss now.

8.4 Gauge transformation

The coordinate basis (∂𝑖) and ˆe5 being given, the adapted basis ( ˆe𝛼) of U to 𝑓 is uniquely
deﬁned by the section 𝑓 . We would like to know to what extend the equation of motion is
independent on the choice of the section 𝑓 . For this aim, we consider another section 𝑓 ′′ and the
corresponding adapted basis ( ˆe′′𝛼). As (𝑇 𝜋) ˆe𝑖 = (𝑇 𝜋) ˆe′′𝑖 = ∂𝑖, the vector ˆe′′𝑖 − ˆe𝑖 is tangent to
the ﬁber of U over X then

the change of basis from ( ˆe𝛼) to ( ˆe′′𝛼) is given by the transformation matrix

ˆe′′5 = ˆe5

ˆe′′𝑖 − ˆe𝑖 = 𝑏𝑖 ˆe5,
ˆ𝑃 𝑓 → 𝑓 ′′ = (cid:20) 1R4

𝑏∗

1 (cid:21)

33

where 𝑏∗ is the 4-row of components 𝑏𝑖 . The set of these matrices is an Abelian group ˆG𝑏 for
the matrix product. To determine whether the ˆG𝑏-structure is integrable, we have to solve the
PDE system

𝜕 ˆ𝑋′′
𝜕 ˆ𝑋

inconvenience

The linear form 𝚽 represented in the basis ( ˆe𝛼) by the 5-arrow

is represented in the basis ( ˆe′′𝛼) by the 5-arrow Φ′′ = Φ ˆ𝑃 𝑓 → 𝑓 ′′ , leading to the gauge transfor-

mation

(101)

As the matrix (80) does not depends on the ﬁfth coordinate, 𝐺 is not modiﬁed by the coordinate
change as well as, owing to (97), ¯𝐹 and 𝐹 = 𝐺−1𝐹. Hence the choice of the section 𝑓 does not
modify the equation of motion (98).

9 Extended variational relativity

The goal of this section is to extend the general theorems of the relativity based on Einstein-
Hilbert functional (Hilbert [1915]). We use Palatini formalism, considering the connection as
an unknown independent ﬁeld (Palatini [1919]).

9.1 Stationary action principle

Inspired by the presentation given in Souriau [1964], we start from the following principles

(P1) To every physical phenomenon corresponds a ﬁeld z, represented in a local chart by a

𝑛(𝑧) -column 𝑧, and a ﬁeld

(𝑧, 𝜕𝑖 𝑧, 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 , 𝐴𝑖) ↦→ 𝐿(𝑧)(𝑧, 𝜕𝑖 𝑧, 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 , 𝐴𝑖) ∈ R

called presence of the phenomenon in Souriau [1964].

𝐿(𝑧) 𝑢 d4 𝑋

(102)

is stationary for every variation of 𝐺, 𝐴∗ and the concomitant phenomena, null on the
boundary of an open domain D of the space-time, 𝑣𝑜𝑙 being the Riemannian volume
4-form.

As the signature of Minkowski metric is (+ − −−), det 𝐺 < 0, then the component of 𝑣𝑜𝑙 is

𝑢 = √

this integral vanishes and it remains

Considering the only non vanishing variation of a particular phenomenon 𝑧 and applying the
fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, we prove (i). Likewise, considering the non
vanishing compactly supported smooth variations of G (resp. A∗), we prove (ii) (resp. (iii)). (cid:4)

Remark. It is worth to remark that the number of ﬁeld equations (i) and (ii), fourteen, is
the same as the number of unknowns (independent components of 𝐺 and 𝐴∗), that avoids being
caught in the dilemma of classical Kaluza-Klein theory: add the dilaton but one condition has no
physical interpretation, or set the dilaton to one to recover Maxwell equations but this condition
is violated.

The principle of stationary action can be used in diﬀerent ways. For instance, it is worth to

notice that the equation (i)

𝑝 − ∇ 𝑗 𝜎 𝑗 = 0

can be obtained considering only the stationarity of the corresponding part 𝑆(𝑧) of the action. It
is this way that we are going to follow from now on.

Corollary 1 div ˜T(𝑧) = 0 for every phenomenon
Proof. According to the gauge transformation (101), we perform the substitution 𝐴𝑖 → 𝐴𝑖 + 𝜕𝑖 ℎ
in the Lagrangian 𝐿(𝑧) of the action 𝑆(𝑧) . Applying the equation (109) to the phenomenon ℎ
(then 𝑝 = 0 and 𝜎𝑗 = ˜𝑇 𝑗
(𝑧)

) gives

that achieves the proof. (cid:4)

div ¯T(𝑧) + ˜T(𝑧) · F = 0

of the 1-contravariant and 1-covariant tensor ¯T(𝑧) of components (𝑇(𝑧))𝑖
Proof. A smooth vector ﬁeld 𝛿X of compact support contained in D is represented in a local
chart by a 4-column 𝛿𝑋 and leads to the variations L 𝛿𝑋 𝑧, L 𝛿𝑋 𝐺 and L 𝛿𝑋 𝐴∗. Owing to (106),

𝑗 = (𝑇(𝑧))𝑖𝑘 𝐺 𝑘 𝑗 .

the corresponding variation of the Lagrangian is given by

Introducing into (108), with the variations given by Lie derivatives, the expression (112) and
(113), and owing to Theorem 9.1 (i), we have

∫D

div [V(𝑧) (L 𝛿X z) + ¯T(𝑧) · 𝛿X + (A∗ · 𝛿X) ˜T(𝑧)] 𝑣𝑜𝑙 −∫D

[div ¯T(𝑧)) + ˜T(𝑧) · F ] · 𝛿X 𝑣𝑜𝑙 = 0

Considering smooth variations of compact support contained in D and reasoning as in the proof
of Theorem 9.1, the ﬁrst integral vanishes and, applying the fundamental lemma of the calculus
of variations, we obtain (111). (cid:4)

Our aim now is to apply these general principle by constructing Lagrangians for three

phenomena, the matter, the gravitation and the electromagnetism.

9.3 Laws of conservation of the matter

Matter manifold

In Souriau [1964, §36], the motion of a continuum is described by a line bundle 𝜋 𝐴 : U → M
where M is a Riemannian manifold of dimension 3 representing the matter and called the
matter manifold. Its metric is denoted G𝑚. Each ﬁber is the trajectory of a material particle
a = 𝜋 𝐴(X). In a local chart of M, it is represented by its Lagrange coordinates 𝑎 ∈ R3. As 𝑎
is an invariant of the motion, the material derivative vanishes:

where U is tangent to the trajectory and deﬁned by (76). In local charts of U and M,

To extend this formalism to the 5D universe ˆU, we consider a line bundle ˆ𝜋 𝐴 :

where ˆM is a manifold of dimension 4 representing the matter in this universe. By analogy with
ˆM → M is a principal 𝑈(1)-bundle.

All we have just done is also valid in ﬁbered bases, not necessarily associated to local

coordinates. As in hypothesis (H2) of Section 8.2, let us consider a ﬁbered basis ( ˆe′𝛼) =
ˆU such that (e′1, · · · , e′4) is an orthonormal basis and in which the
( ˆe′1, · · · , ˆe′4, ˆ𝛀0) of 𝑇 ˆX
tangent map 𝑇 ˆ𝜋 𝐴 is represented by the matrix

where 𝑀′ is full rank and 𝜇′ ≠ 0. Let us verify now that 7 is the number of independent invariants
of

ˆ𝑀′ for the action of ˆG0

ˆ𝑀′ = (cid:20) 𝑀′ 0
𝜇′ (cid:21)

(115)

We determine the isotropy group of
respect to ˆ𝑃 given by (37), itemized as

ˆ𝑀′ by solving the system of equations

ˆ𝑀′ = ˆ𝑀′ ˆ𝑃 with

𝑀′ = 𝑀′ 𝑃,

Φ′ = Φ′ 𝑃 + 𝜇′ 𝑏∗,

𝜇′ = 𝜇′

where 𝑃 is a Lorentz transformation and the last equation is trivially fulﬁlled. Like in Section
6.3, we diﬀerentiate these equations with respect to ˆ𝑃 at the identity and we take into account
that 𝑃 is skew-adjoint, that leads to determine the non vanishing solutions (𝛿𝑃, 𝛿𝑏) of the linear
system

𝑀′ 𝛿𝑃 = 0,

Φ′ 𝛿𝑃 + 𝜇′ 𝛿𝑏∗ = 0

(116)

where 𝛿𝑃∗ = − 𝛿𝑃. According to Theorem 2.1 ♦, if 𝛿𝑃 ≠ 0 there exist two linear independent
vectors 𝑉1, 𝑉2 ∈ R4 such that 𝛿𝑃 = J (𝑉1, 𝑉2). if 𝑀′∗1 , 𝑀′∗2 , 𝑀′∗3 are the rows of 𝑀′, then the ﬁrst
equation is satisﬁed if 𝑀′∗𝑘 J (𝑉1, 𝑉2) = −(J (𝑉1, 𝑉2) 𝑀𝑘)∗ = 0 for 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 3, that implies there
exists a linear combination between the rows of 𝑀′ and 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘( 𝑀′) < 3, in contradiction with the
hypothesis of full rank, then 𝛿𝑃 = 0. As 𝜇 ≠ 0, the second equation (116) shows that 𝛿𝑏 = 0.
The isotropy group of 𝑀′ is reduce to the identity. The dimension of the orbit is

dim (orb( ˆ𝑀′)) = dim ˆG0 − dim(iso( ˆ𝑀′)) = 10 − 0 = 10

The dimension of the set 𝑉𝑀 of matrices (115) is 3× 4+ 4+ 1 = 17 (the number of non vanishing
components). The number of independent invariants of the orbit is

𝑛𝐼 = dim 𝑉𝑀 − dim(orb( ˆ𝑀′)) = 17 − 10 = 7

A set of independent invariants are 𝜇 and the 6 independent elements of the 3 × 3 matrix

𝐻′ = 𝑀′ 𝑀′∗ = 𝑀′(𝐺′0)−1 𝑀′𝑇 𝐺 𝑚

in which 𝐺′0 is Minkowski’s metric (69) and 𝐺 𝑚 is Gram’s matrix of G𝑚. As in Souriau [1964],
we suppose that the behavior of the matter is isotropic

𝐺 𝑚 = R3,

𝑀∗ = 𝐺−1𝑀 𝑇 ,

𝐻 = 𝑀 𝑀∗ = 𝑀 𝐺−1𝑀 𝑇

The matrix 𝐻 represents in a local frame of M a skew-symmetric tensor

H = 𝑇 𝜋 𝐴(𝑇 𝜋 𝐴)∗

called conformation in Souriau [1964].

As in Section 8.3, we would like now to work with a coordinate frame (∂1, · · · , ∂4) and the
corresponding ﬁbered frame adapted to the section 𝑓 , obtained by the change of basis (78) with
the transformation matrix ˆ𝑃 given by (79) and in which 𝑇 ˆ𝜋 𝐴 is represented by the matrix

If 𝜇 ≠ 0, the matrix ˆ𝑀 being known, the vector
where 𝑀 = 𝑀′𝑃, Φ = Φ′𝑃 and 𝜇 = 𝜇′.
ˆ𝑈 tangent to the trajectory is obtained by solving the equation 𝑀 𝑈 = 0, next by calculating

ˆ𝑀 = ˆ𝑀′ ˆ𝑃 = (cid:20) 𝑀

Φ − 2 𝜇 𝐴∗ 𝜇 (cid:21)

40

ˆ𝑈5 = (Φ − 2 𝜇 𝐴∗) 𝑈/𝜇. Later on, as we are only interested by the trajectory in the space-time
when we reduce the problem by pullback as in Section 8.3, we can consider only the conformation
as invariant, assuming without loss of generality that 𝜇 = 𝜕5𝑎4 = 0, Φ = 2 𝜇 𝐴∗, then the value
of ˆ𝑈5 is arbitrary.

Flux of a physical quantity

Now we follow the construction proposed in Souriau [1964, (36.7)]. Let a ↦→ 𝑟0(a) be
a non-vanishing scalar ﬁeld on M representing the density of an extensive physical quantity
(for instance, the mass or the electric charge), 𝑣𝑜𝑙 be the Riemannian volume 4-form on the
space-time U, 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑚 be the Riemannian volume 3-form on the matter manifold M, and 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑟0 be
the volume 3-form 𝑟0 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑚. We deﬁne on the space-time the vector ﬁeld J𝑟 such that

In local chart, for any 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑑3 𝑋 ∈ R4

𝜄J𝑟 𝑣𝑜𝑙 = 𝜋∗𝐴(𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑟0)

𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝐽𝑟 , 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑑3 𝑋) = 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑟0( 𝑀 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑀 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑀 𝑑3 𝑋)

In Souriau [1965, Chapter 5, §14, Theorem (16)], it is proved that this vector exists and is
unique. As 𝑟0 ≠ 0, (118) shows that J𝑟 vanishes only if the rank of 𝑀 is less than 3. Otherwise,
in choosing 𝑀 𝑑1 𝑋 = 𝐽𝑟 , we see that

(117)

(118)

(119)

𝜕𝑎

𝐽𝑟 = 𝑀 𝐽𝑟 = 0

then J𝑟 (X) is tangent to the trajectory passing by X. In Souriau [1964, (36.13)], it is proved
that

Theorem 9.3 If 𝐽𝑟 is not lightlike

(i) we have

then the conformation matrix 𝐻 = 𝑀 𝑀∗ is regular

(𝐽𝑟)∗𝐽𝑟 = −(𝑟0)2 det 𝐻

(ii) the orthogonal projection matrix onto 𝐽𝑟 is

Assuming that 𝐽𝑟 is timelike, we deduce from (i) that

Introducing

𝐽𝑟 (𝐽𝑟)∗
(𝐽𝑟)∗𝐽𝑟

= 1R4 − 𝑀∗𝐻−1 𝑀

ℎ = − det 𝐻 > 0

𝑟 = 𝑟0√ℎ

41

the unique vector J𝑟 satisfying (117) is the tangent vector to the trajectory of which the length is
given by (𝐽𝑟)∗𝐽𝑟 = 𝑟 2, then we can put 𝐽𝑟 = 𝑟 𝑈 with 𝑈∗𝑈 = 1, representing the 4-ﬂux of 𝑟

J𝑟 = 𝑟 U = 𝑟

𝑑X
𝑑𝑠

where 𝑟 is a short form of 𝑟0(𝜋 𝐴(X))pdet (𝑇 𝜋 𝐴(𝑇 𝜋 𝐴)∗). Reasoning as in the proof of Theorem

9.1 and owing to (117), we have

div (J𝑟) 𝑣𝑜𝑙 = LJ𝑟 𝑣𝑜𝑙 = 𝑑[𝜄J𝑟 𝑣𝑜𝑙] = 𝜋∗𝐴(𝑑(𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑟0)) = 0

because 𝑑(𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑟0) is a 4-form ﬁeld on M of dimension 3, then we obtain the conservation identity
of the 4-ﬂux of 𝑟

div J𝑟 = 0

(120)

Lagrangian of the matter

On this ground, our aim is to construct a Lagrangian 𝐿 𝑀 for the matter that is invariant for

every diﬀeomorphism 𝜑 of the space-time U

𝐿 𝑀(a, 𝑇 𝜋 𝐴, G, A∗) = 𝐿 𝑀(a, 𝑇 𝜋 𝐴 ◦ 𝑇 𝜑, 𝜑∗(G), 𝜑∗(A∗))

where 𝜑∗ stands for the pullback by 𝜑 and A∗ is the adjoint of A. In local charts, for every
transformation matrix 𝑃

𝐿 𝑀(𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐺, 𝐴∗) = 𝐿 𝑀(𝑎′, 𝑀′, 𝐺′, 𝐴′∗),

𝑎 = 𝑎′, 𝑀′ = 𝑀 𝑃, 𝐺′ = 𝑃𝑇 𝐺 𝑃,

𝐴′∗ = 𝐴∗𝑃

Particles without spin are characterized by two physical quantities, their mass (or energy if 𝑐 = 1)
and their electric charge. Hence, the Lagrangian must at least depend on the densities of mass
and charge. According to the principle of stationary action (P2), we adopt the decomposition

𝐿 𝑀(𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐺, 𝐴∗) = 𝜅 [𝐿𝑚(𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐺) + 𝐿𝑒(𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐴∗)]

where 𝜅 is a non vanishing coupling constant, 𝐿𝑚 is active for all particles, charged or not,
sensitive to the gravitation forces, while 𝐿𝑒 is active only for charged particles, sensitive also
to the electromagnetic forces. For 𝐿𝑚 being invariant, it must depend on 𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐺 through the
invariants 𝑎 and 𝐻. At this stage, we restrict our presentation to ﬂuids then the dependence on
𝐻 can be limited to a dependence on ℎ = − det 𝐻 only. The expression

contains the mass density

𝐿𝑚(𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐺) = 𝜌𝑚0(𝑎) [

𝜌𝑚 = 𝜌𝑚0(𝑎)

√ℎ + 𝜓(ℎ)]
√ℎ

that can be completed by an internal energy to modelize pressure eﬀects through the function
𝜓. For 𝐿𝑒 being invariant, it must depend on the invariants constructed from 𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐺, 𝐴∗. We

42

already know the invariants 𝑎 and ℎ to which we have to add a joint invariant of 𝑀 and 𝐴∗. The
electric current density J𝜌𝑒 is the 4-ﬂux of the electric charge density

deﬁned by, according to (118)

𝜌𝑒 = 𝜌𝑒0(𝑎)

√ℎ

𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝐽𝜌𝑒 , 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑑3 𝑋) = 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝜌𝑒0( 𝑀 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑀 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑀 𝑑3 𝑋)

On the other hand,

𝜌𝑒0 det(cid:20) 𝑀
𝑀 𝐽𝜌𝑒 (cid:21) ,(cid:20) 𝐴∗𝑑1 𝑋,

𝐴∗ (cid:21) 𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝐽𝜌𝑒 , 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑑3 𝑋)
𝑀 𝑑1 𝑋, (cid:21) ,(cid:20) 𝐴∗𝑑2 𝑋,

= −𝜌𝑒0 𝑣𝑜𝑙(cid:18)(cid:20) 𝐴∗𝐽𝜌𝑒
𝐴∗ (cid:21) 𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝐽𝜌𝑒 , 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑑3 𝑋) = ( 𝐴∗𝐽𝜌𝑒) 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝜌𝑒0( 𝑀 𝑑1 𝑋, 𝑀 𝑑2 𝑋, 𝑀 𝑑3 𝑋)

𝑀 𝑑2 𝑋, (cid:21) ,(cid:20) 𝐴∗𝑑3 𝑋,

𝑀 𝑑3 𝑋, (cid:21) ,(cid:19)

𝜌𝑒0 det(cid:20) 𝑀

Taking into account the property (119), we have 𝑀 𝐽𝜌𝑒 = 0 then

Owing to (122), we construct a function

𝐿𝑒(𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐴∗) = 𝜌𝑒0(𝑎) det(cid:20) 𝑀

𝐴∗ (cid:21) = −𝐴∗𝐽𝜌𝑒 = −𝜌𝑒 𝐴∗𝑈

which is invariant because 𝐴′∗𝑈′ = ( 𝐴∗𝑃)(𝑃−1𝑈) = 𝐴∗𝑈 and the electric charge density is

invariant.

In a nutshell, the Lagrangian of the matter reads

𝐿 𝑀(𝑎, 𝑀, 𝐺, 𝐴∗) = 𝜅 [( 𝜌𝑚0 − 𝜌𝑒0 𝐴∗𝑈)

√ℎ + 𝜌𝑚0 𝜓(ℎ)]

which can be enriched to modelize more complex behaviors such as, for instance, those of
hyperelastic solids for which the lagrangian depends on the invariant conformation 𝐻 in a
general way, not only through ℎ.

Principle of stationary action and law of conservation

Owing to (104), the components of the vector ˜T𝑀 read

Applying the principle of stationary action, Corollary 1 gives

( ˜𝑇𝑀)𝑖 = −𝜅 (𝐽𝜌𝑒)𝑖 = −𝜅 𝜌𝑒𝑈𝑖

(121)

(122)

(123)

(124)

which is satisﬁed because of the conservation of the 4-ﬂux of electric charge density 𝜌𝑒, according
to (120).

divJ𝜌𝑒 = 0

43

To obtain the law of conservation, we have to determine the expression of 𝐸 𝑗 𝑘 by diﬀeren-
through ℎ, then denoting 𝜕ℎ the partial

tiation the Lagrangian with respect to the metric, i.e.
derivative with respect to ℎ

𝛿𝐿 𝑀 = 𝜕ℎ 𝐿 𝑀 𝛿ℎ = −𝜕ℎ 𝐿 𝑀 𝛿(det 𝐻) = ℎ 𝜕ℎ 𝐿 𝑀𝑇 𝑟(𝐻−1𝛿𝐻)

Using Theorem 9.3) (ii) with 𝐽𝜌𝑚 = 𝜌𝑚𝑈, it holds

𝛿𝐿 𝑀 = −ℎ 𝜕ℎ 𝐿 𝑀𝑇 𝑟(𝐺−1(1R4 − 𝑈 𝑈∗)𝐺−1𝛿𝐺) = ℎ 𝜕ℎ 𝐿 𝑀𝑇 𝑟((𝑈 𝑈𝑇 − 𝐺−1)𝛿𝐺)

or in tensor notation

from which we deduce the components (105) of the tensor ﬁeld T𝑀

𝐸 𝑗 𝑘 = ℎ 𝜕ℎ 𝐿 𝑀(𝐺 𝑗 𝑘 − 𝑈 𝑗𝑈 𝑘)

(𝑇𝑀)𝑖 𝑗 = 2 𝐸 𝑖 𝑗

𝑀 + 𝐿 𝑀 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜅 [( 𝜌 + 𝑝)𝑈𝑖𝑈 𝑗 − 𝑝 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗]

(125)

in which occur the density of energy

𝜌 = 𝐿 𝑀/𝜅 = ( 𝜌𝑚0 − 𝜌𝑒0 𝐴∗𝑈)

√ℎ + 𝜌𝑚0 𝜓(ℎ) = 𝜌𝑚 + 𝜌𝑚0 𝜓(ℎ) − 𝐴∗𝐽𝜌𝑒

where the second and third terms represent respectively the internal energy and the coupling with
the electromagnetism, and the pressure

𝑝 = (2𝜕ℎ 𝐿 𝑀 − 𝐿 𝑀)/𝜅 = 𝜌𝑚0 (2 ℎ 𝜕ℎ𝜓 − 𝜓)

The law of conservation (111) for the matter

itemizes, owing to (123) and (125), into

∇𝑖(𝑇𝑀)𝑖

𝑗 + ( ˜𝑇𝑀) 𝑘 𝐹𝑘 𝑗 = 0

of these expressions. Mimicking the linear 5-momentum of an elementary particule deﬁned by
(75) and (88), we claim that the components of the linear 5-momentum of a continuum are

ˆΠ 𝑗 = 𝜌𝑈 𝑗 − 2 𝜌𝑒 𝐴 𝑗 ,

ˆΠ5 = 𝜌𝑒

Adding a projection term to take into account the eﬀects of the pressure 𝑝, we claim that

∇𝑖[( 𝜌 + 𝑝)𝑈𝑖𝑈 𝑗 − 𝑝 𝛿𝑖

𝑗] − 𝜌𝑒𝑈𝑖 𝐹𝑖 𝑗 = 0,

∇𝑖( 𝜌𝑒𝑈𝑖) = 0

then, by comparison to (124) and (126), is equivalent to the equations provided by the principle
of stationary action and the law of conservation

div ˜T𝑀 = 0,

div ¯T𝑀 + ˜T𝑀 · F = 0

9.4 Field equations of the gravitation and electromagnetism

In general relativity, the gravitation is represented by the geometry of the space-time through the
connection Γ generated by 10 potentials, the independent components of the metric 𝐺. In our
uniﬁed theory of gravitation and electromagnetism, the geometry of the space-time stems from
the ˆG0-connection ˆΓ preserving the pullback ˆG0 of the space-time metric and the vector ˆ𝛀0. It
is generated by 14 potentials, the independent components of 𝐺 and 𝐴∗.

Curvature tensor

Our starting point is to calculate the curvature tensor ˆR on the space-time U endowed with
the pullback connection. This tensor is deﬁned, for any smooth section ˆW of 𝑇 ˆU and for all
smooth ﬁelds X ↦→ U , X ↦→ V of tangent vectors to the space-time, by the relation
ˆW = ˆR(U , V )

ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 ) U ( ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 ) V ˆW) − ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 ) V ( ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 ) U ˆW) − ˆ∇(𝑇 𝑓 ) [U ,V ]

ˆW (128)

Then it is a 1-contravariant and 3-covariant tensor, skew-symmetric with respect to the arguments
U and V . With the convention that Greek indices run from 1 to 5 and Latin ones run from 1 to
4, it is represented by the components

Lagrangian of the geometry

According to Souriau [1964, Chapter 5, §14, (35.8) to (35.10)], the Lagrangian of the

geometry depends on the connection and its partial derivatives through the curvature tensor

𝐿𝐺( ˆΓ, 𝜕𝑖 ˆΓ, G, A∗) = 𝐿𝐺( ˆΓ, ˆR, G, A∗)

We assume the decomposition

𝐿𝐺( ˆΓ, ˆR, G, A∗) = 𝐿𝑔(Γ, R, G) + 𝐿𝑒𝑚(Γ5, ˜R, G, A∗)

where 𝐿𝑔 describes the behavior of the gravitation alone and 𝐿𝑒𝑚 is an extra term to take
into account the one of the electromagnetism. The Lagrangian must be invariant for every
diﬀeomorphism of the space-time.
Introducing the Ricci tensor of components obtained by
contraction

the most simple invariant built from 𝑅 𝑝

𝑖 𝑗 𝑘 and 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 is the scalar curvature

𝑅 𝑗 𝑘 = 𝑅 𝑝

𝑝 𝑗 𝑘

𝑅 = 𝐺 𝑗 𝑘 𝑅 𝑗 𝑘

The Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian including the cosmological constant Λ is

𝐿𝑔(Γ, R, R) = −Λ +

𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 𝑅𝑖 𝑗

Besides, from ˜𝑅𝑖 𝑗 𝑘 , 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 and 𝐴𝑖, we can construct the invariant

˜𝑅 = 𝐴𝑟 𝐺𝑟 𝑖𝐺 𝑗 𝑘 ˜𝑅𝑖 𝑗 𝑘 = 𝐴𝑟 ˜𝑅𝑟 𝑘

(130)

Then we consider the Lagrangian of the electromagnetism

𝐿𝑒𝑚(Γ5, ˜R, G, A∗) = − ˜𝑘 𝐴𝑟 𝐺𝑟 𝑖𝐺 𝑗 𝑘 ˜𝑅𝑖 𝑗 𝑘

where ˜𝑘 is a new coupling constant.

In a nutshell, the Lagrangian of the geometry reads

𝐿𝐺( ˆΓ, ˆR, G, A∗) = −Λ +

Applying the stationary action principle (Theorem 9.1, (ii) and (iii)), we have

T = T𝐺 + T𝑀 = 0,

˜T = ˜T𝐺 + ˜T𝑀 = 0

which, owing to (123), (125), (131) and (132), leads to

In the absence of the electromagnetic potential, the ﬁrst equation is reduced to

𝑅 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 + Λ 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜅 [( 𝜌 + 𝑝)𝑈𝑖𝑈 𝑗 − 𝑝 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗]

We recover Einstein’s equations for the gravitation. Einstein’s constant (with 𝑐 = 1 and the
gravitational constant 𝐺 𝑁 with the index 𝑁 in Newton’s honour)

𝜅 = 8 𝜋 𝐺 𝑁

has been chosen such that the non-relativistic limit yields the usual form of Newton’s law of
universal gravitation.

Our aim now is to discuss the classical limits of these ﬁeld equations, starting with (134).
First, we consider the ﬁrst term.

simpliﬁcation

(136)

Next, we would like to assess the order of magnitude of the second term with respect to the

ﬁrst one in (134), i.e. the coupling term between gravitation and electromagnetism containing

of the order of ¯𝐿−2 ¯𝐴 ¯𝜑, then can be neglected because, at the Newtonian approximation, ¯𝜑 ≪ 1

(with units such that 𝑐 = 1) and (134) is reduced to the second group of Maxwell equations
(Maxwell-Gauss and Maxwell-Amp`ere laws)

then

or

curl 𝐵 = 𝜕𝑡 𝐸 + 𝜇0 𝜌𝑒𝑣𝑖

where 𝜇0 = (𝜖0)−1 is the permeability (bearing in mind that 𝑐 = 1), while, because the 2-form
F is closed, its exterior derivative is zero and we recover the ﬁrst group (Maxwell-Faraday and
Maxwell-Thomson laws)

curl 𝐸 + 𝜕𝑡 𝐵 = 0,

div 𝐵 = 0

Remark 1. The previous approximation is rough. In many situation, it can be improved,
depending on the reference length, notably when the gravity can be considered on the Earth as
constant.

Remark 2. Besides, incorporating Coriolis’ eﬀects in the analysis of orders of magnitude
leads to more complex expressions but the conclusion concerning the order of the second term
of (134) remains.

Next, we look back to the classical limit of the former ﬁeld equation (133), taking into

account (138)

𝑅𝑖 𝑗−

𝑅 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗+Λ 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗−8 𝜋 𝐺 𝑁 𝜖0 [ 𝐴(𝑖 ˜𝑅 𝑗) 𝑘

˜𝑅 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗] = 8 𝜋 𝐺 𝑁 [( 𝜌+ 𝑝)𝑈𝑖𝑈 𝑗− 𝑝 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗]

2

To be consistent, the second term in (129) is neglected and, at the Newtonian approximation, the
invariant (130) is reduced to

˜𝑅 = 𝐴𝑖 𝜕 𝑗 𝐹 𝑗𝑖

Being interested by the order of magnitude, we withhold only the term with 𝐴𝑡 = 𝜙 in ˜𝑅, then

𝐺 𝑁 𝜖0 ˜𝑅 ≈ 𝐺 𝑁 𝜙 𝜖0 div 𝐸 ≈ 𝐺 𝑁 𝜌𝑒𝜙

Comparing to the order of magnitude 𝐺 𝑁 𝜌 of the right hand member of (133), we conclude
that the coupling term can be neglected. Indeed, 𝜌𝑒𝜙 is the stored electric energy density, very
negligible with respect to the energy density 𝜌 (that is 𝜌 𝑐2 in SI units).

Remark. Arguably, this particularly very small coupling term in (133) can be related to
Dirac’s Large Number Hypothesis (LNH) that the ratio of the electrical to the gravitational forces
between a proton and an electron of electric charge 𝑒

constitutes a very large dimensionless number, some 40 orders of magnitude today, indeed the
coupling constant is

where the inverse ratio 𝐹𝑔/𝐹𝑒 is about 10−40. Observing the coincidence of the ratio of this force

scales and that of the size scales in the Universe, Paul Dirac [1937] made the conjecture that
physical constants are actually not constant and the gravitational constant is inversely proportional
to the age of the Universe. The author would also to draw the attention on the coincidence with

𝑒 𝑐

More in-depth discussion should be given in relation with the cosmological scenario for the
evolution of elementary particle structure of Section 7.

In contrast, if the classical approximations above are not relevant, the gravitation and elec-

tromagnetism ﬁelds are coupled through the equations

𝑅𝑖 𝑗−

𝑅 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗+Λ 𝐺 𝑖 𝑗−8 𝜋 𝐺 𝑁 𝜖0 [ 𝐴(𝑖 ˜𝑅 𝑗) 𝑘

𝜖0 [∇ 𝑗 𝐹 𝑗𝑖 + 2𝐴𝑞 𝑅𝑞𝑖 𝑗

In particular, in presence of a strong gravitation ﬁeld, Maxwell equations have to be modiﬁed,
by considering the covariant derivative instead of the partial derivative.

10 Conclusion

Firstly, we proposed a symmetry group ˆG0 for which the electric charge of a particle is an invariant
of its coadjoint orbit, then of which the value does not depend on the observer. Secondly, we
constructed a ˆG0-connection allowing to recover the expected equation of motion today of a
particle, including Lorentz force and proving the charge is an integral of the motion. Finally, we
deduced from a 5D extension of the variational relativity the ﬁeld equations where, at the classical
limit, the coupling term is negligible and we recover Einstein equations for the gravitation and
Maxwell equations, without need to introduce a dilaton or to violate an equation as in the classical
Kaluza-Klein theory.

Author’s opinion is that these results are strong arguments to claim that the Lie group ˆG0 is

the symmetry group of the electrodynamics compatible with the observations today.

In contrast, we aﬃrm that the symmetry group ˆG1 of the Kaluza-Klein theory leads to a
classiﬁcation of the elementary particles in the framework of an uniﬁed theory merging the
gravitational and electromagnetic forces relevant to describe the early Universe.

The soon idea of a ﬁfth dimension, if used in a suitable geometric formalism taking into
account its very small size, seems now more than ever to oﬀer a promising future for new
developments among them we can emphasize:

50

1. For the characterization of charged elementary particles, we largely relied on Souriau
[1970, 1997b] without releasing the full potential of the theoretical framework, in particular
the construction of the symplectic form and the geometric quantization. These issues have
not been considered yet in this work but would deserve to be investigated.

2. The next step would be to extend Kaluza-Klein theory to a non-abelian gauge group as
in Kerner [1968] with the mathematical tools developed in this paper, in particular the
coadjoint orbit method.

3. Going back in time, it would worth to revisit works on the early universe cosmology that
we think they did not receive the welcome they deserved because based on Kaluza-Klein
theory whose weaknesses were known. They could provide a better understanding for
Dirac’s large number hypothesis as suggested by Chodos and Detweiler [1980] and to
oﬀer a resolution to the horizon problem as claimed by Sahdev [1984].
