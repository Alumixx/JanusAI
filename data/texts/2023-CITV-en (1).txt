Abstract:	We	derive	the	two	field	equations	of	the	Cosmological	Janus	model	of	an	action.	
We	then	construct	an	unsteady	solution	describing	a	homogeneous	and	isotropic	situation.	
Stationary	solutions	with	spherical	symmetry	are	considered.	It	is	shown,	in	the	state	of	
research,	that	these	make	it	possible	to	describe	systems	close	to	their	Newtonian	
approximation.	We	then	review	the	agreement	between	the	model	and	the	observational	
data,	including	those	where	there	is	a	disagreement	between	what	the	standard	ΛCDM	
model	provides	and	these	data,	when	the	latter	fails	to	provide	their	modeling.	The	link	with	
dynamic	group	theory	is	presented.	
_________________________________________________________________________________________________	
1	- Introduction	:	The	standard	ΛCDM	cosmological	model	is	based	on	the	assumption	of	
the	existence	of	two	entities	considered	to	be	independent:	dark	matter	and	dark	energy.	
Years	have	passed	and	despite	increasing	budgets	for	attempts	to	highlight	particles	of	dark	
matter,	in	mines	or	tunnels,	no	tangible	results	have	appeared	to	date.	For	dark	energy	the	
situation	is	even	more	critical	in	the	sense	that	to	date	there	is	no	model	claiming	to	describe	
it.	It	is	therefore	quite	legitimate	and	beneficial	to	consider	an	alternative	to	the	ΛCDM	
model,	based	on	the	principle	of	Occam's	razor.	With	this	in	mind,	an	alternative	cosmology	
should	account	for	all	the	observational	aspects	taken	to	date	by	the	current	model,	offer	a	
more	coherent	vision	and,	to	hold	the	attention	of	the	scientific	community,	account	for	
phenomena	for	which	the	standard	model	does	not	provide	no	convincing	modeling,	or	
provide	none.	
	2	– The	introduction	into	the	model	of	masses	and	negative	energies.			
						This	has	been	tried	for	a	long	time	[1].	But	this	attempt	by	Herman	Bondi	resulted	in	the	
violation	of	the	fundamental	principles	of	physics,	which	are	the	principle	of	action-reaction	
and	the	principle	of	equivalence.	Conclusion:	it	is	impossible	to	integrate	negative	masses	
into	the	model	of	general	relativity,	based	on	Einstein's	equation.	We	will	therefore	consider	
a	necessary	extension	of	the	geometric	context.	
					General	relativity	has	a	metric	
gµν	as	its	solution.	From	this,	we	can	build	the	geodesics,	
curves	which	must	be	followed	indifferently	by	the	positive	or	negative	masses	and,	in	the	
case	of	geodesics	of	zero	length,	by	photons	of	positive	energy	or	negative	energy.	It	is

because	of	this	that	the	principles	of	action	and	reaction	and	equivalence	of	physics	are	
violated.	It	will	therefore	be	considered	that	the	masses	and	the	photons	of	positive	energy	
follow	the	geodesics	constructed	from	a	metric	field 
( + )	and	that	the	negative	masses	and	
photons	of	negative	energy	follow	the	geodesics	resulting	from	a	second	metric	field	 
( − ).	We	
therefore	consider	a	geometric	structure	composed	of	two	sheets,	or	branes	F(+)	and	F(-).	The	
points	of	these	hypersurfaces,	or	branes,	are	coupled	two	by	two	by	the	fact	that	the	terms	of	
the	metric	are	calculated	from	the	same	set	of	four	coordinates:		
	(1)

}the	space	variables.	The	metrics	are	both	
					x°	is	the	chronological	variable,	and	  ξ1, ξ2, ξ3
assumed	to	be	Riemanian,	of	signature	(+	-	-	-).	We	can	then	define	two	different	observers,	
one	consisting	of	positive	mass	and	the	other	of	negative	mass.	Both	perceive	phenomena	in	
through	
} and	
their	 own	 brane	
}.	We	introduce	two	scale	factors	 a ( + )and a ( − )as	well	as	two	different	speeds	
of	light	 c( + )and	 c( − )	a	priori	different.	The	Lorentzian	metrics,	tangents,	being	:

					The	coordinates	by	which	observers	interpret	the	phenomena	taking	place	in	their	own	
brane	are:		
 (3)																																
			
				We	will	choose	the	value	 ε = −1	so	as	to	introduce	a	PT-symmetry.	Subsequently,	by	
adding	a	fifth	space-like	dimension,	the	two	geometric	entities	will	be	linked	by	a	CPT-
symmetry.	
	3	– Derivation	of	the	system	of	two	coupled	field	equations	from	an	action.	
    Consider	the	action:

   	With  κ = ± 1. After	having	operated	the	variation	of	the	action,	one	poses:

x ( − ) = εa(−)ξ1
y( − ) = εa(−)ξ2

				The	first	equation	is	then	identified	with	Einstein's	equation,	without	its	cosmological

In	the	Newtonian	approximation	it	comes,	from	the	first	equation	(13a)	the	law:

implies	that	the	action	of	a	positive	mass	on	
a	negative	mass	has	an	effect	of	apparent	mass,	that	is	to	say	that	these	positive	masses	act

					Let	us	now	consider	a	region	of	space	where	it	is	this	time	the	negative	masses	which	
dominate.	The	system	becomes:	
	(15a)																																									
(15b)																																									
				The	apparent	mass	effect	will	this	time	affect	the	negative	masses,	acting	on	the	positive	
masses.	
(16)																																																														
						If	we	opt	for κ = +1	we	fall	back	on	the	runaway	effect.	The	choice	 κ = −1therefore	
constitutes	a	way	of	reconstituting	at	the	same	time	the	principle	of	action-reaction	and	
equivalence,	the	system,	which	becomes	the	cosmological	Janus	model,	being	written	in	its	
covariant	form:

The	interaction	laws	therefore	correspond	to	the	diagram	below:

	-	Masses	of	opposite	signs	repel	each	other	according	to	anti-Newton	
	5	– Solution	existence	condition. 
 				We	can	only	build	exact	solutions	of	Einstein's	equation	in	the	following	three	cases:		
	-	Unsteady	solutions	with	assumption	of	isotropy	and	homogeneity.	(FLRW	metric)		-	
Stationary	solutions	with	O(3)	symmetry	(	Schwarzschild	metrics	)			
	-  Stationary	solutions	with	O(2)	symmetry	(	Kerr	metric	)

					This	aspect	constitutes	one	of	the	arguments	in	favor	of	the	present	model,	insofar	as	the	
standard	model	is	incapable	of	accounting	for	the	observation	by	the	James	Webb	telescope	
of	spiral	galaxies,	massive,	endowed	with	their	thin	disk	of	gas	when	the	universe	is	only	500	
million	years	old.					This	model	is	also	the	only	one	to	provide	a	coherent	explanation	of	the	
Repeller	dipole	phenomenon	[10].	
	

	

la	

Figure	4	:	The	Dipole	Repeller	

	

					This	structure	offers	the	possibility	of	confirming	or	invalidating	the	model.	Indeed	the	
light	emitted	by	sources	located	in	the	background	of	the	repeller	dipole	will	undergo,	by	
negative	gravitational	lensing	effect,	a	decrease	in	their	luminosity.	This	effect	should	make	
it	possible	to	determine	the	diameter	of	the	object	located	in	the	center	of	this	cell.	It	is	
invisible	because	the	negative	energy	photons	it	emits	cannot	be	picked	up	by	our	
telescopes.	Remember	that	sources	with	a	redshift	greater	than	7	led	specialists	to	believe	
that	the	first	galaxies	to	form	would	be	dwarfs.	In	fact,	the	galaxies	immediately	acquire	their	
normal	masses	and	sizes.	It	is	this	gravitational	lensing	effect	that	makes	them	appear	like	
this.	The	JWST	observations	are	worth	this	prediction.	As	soon	as	they	are	formed,	the	
negative	mass	invades	the	space	between	the	galaxies.	This	confines	them	and	gives	their	
rotation	curves	that	flat	shape,	on	the	periphery,	that	we	know	from	them.

Fig.5:	Confinement	of	galaxies.	

	

				These	gaps	in	the	negative	mass	are	the	source	of	a	positive	gravitational	lensing	effect,	
which	is	calculated	by	considering	that	this	gap	is	equivalent	to	the	superposition	of	a	
uniform	distribution	of	negative	mass	and	an	equivalent	distribution	of	positive	mass.	This	
same	phenomenon	of	confinement	manifests	itself	in	the	same	way	for	clusters	of	galaxies.	
As	a	general	rule,	the	negative	mass	distribution	accounts	for	all	the	phenomena	for	which	it	
was	necessary	to	resort	to	the	sober	matter-dark	energy	couple.	The	diagram	below	
summarizes	this	change	of	model:	
		

	

Fig.6		:	Compared	contents	of	the	two	models.	.		

						It	is	interesting	to	continue	to	identify	the	interpretations	of	phenomena	that	are	to	the	
advantage	of	the	Janus	model,	compared	to	the	ΛCDM	model.	In	the	standard	approach,	we	
do	not	have	the	mechanisms	allowing	the	spiral	structures	to	form	and	persist.	Some	
formations	have	suggested	that	these	structures	resulted	from	encounters	between	galaxies.	
But	when	you	introduce	these	spiral	formations	as	initial	conditions,	they	dissipate	very	
quickly,	in	little	more	than	one	turn.	In	addition,	many	galaxies	exhibit	spiral	structures,	
although	the	portion	of	space	in	which	they	reside	makes	it	difficult	to	believe	that	these	
structures	are	the	result	of	an	encounter.	The	Janus	model	shows	that	this	spiral	structure	
translates	the	way	in	which	the	mass	point	systems	constituting	the	galaxies	transfer	

	
13	
angular	momentum	to	their	negative	mass	environment	through	density	waves	which	have	
their	counterpart	in	the	negative	mass.	Numerical	simulations	[11]	indicated	how	these	
structures	were	formed,	which	could	persist	for	more	than	30	laps.	
	

Fig.7:	Barred	spiral	structure,	simulation.		
On	the	right	the	loss	of	angular	momentum.	

	
						This	interpretation	explains	why	the	spiral	structures	introduced	as	initial	conditions	
dissipate	so	quickly.	It	is	as	if	people	were	trying	to	understand	the	formation	and	
persistence	of	sea	waves,	forgetting	what	creates	them:	the	wind.		In	the	first	hundred	
million	years	more	or	less	massive	galaxies	are	formed.	All	behave	like	a	kind	of	oven,	their	
young	stars	heating	the	residual	gas	thanks	to	the	UV	radiation	they	emit.	Two	scenarios	
then	arise.	If	the	galaxy	is	sufficiently	massive,	the	gas	acquires	a	temperature	such	that	the	
speed	of	agitation	of	the	atoms	that	compose	it	exceeds	the	speed	of	release.	This	gas	is	then	
ejected	out	of	the	galaxy	and	dissipates	into	intergalactic	space.	A	lighter	galaxy	will	create	a	
gas	halo.	At	this	time	the	young	galaxies	are	still	very	close	to	each	other.	The	encounters	
that	occur	translate	a	redistribution	of	kinetic	energy	into	angular	momentum.	This	transfer	
benefits	the	gas	halo,	not	the	set	of	globular	clusters	whose	stars	created	the	formation	and	
expansion	of	the	halo.	The	expansion	pushes	the	galaxies	away	from	each	other.	The	gas	is	
cooled	by	radiation.	Retaining	the	angular	momentum	acquired	during	the	encounters,	the	
gas	halo	turns	into	a	flat	disc.	The	spiral	structure	forms	immediately,	whose	density	waves	
will	cause	the	birth	of	second-generation	stars.	These,	accelerated	by	the	slingshot	effect	
during	encounters	with	packets	of	gas,	then	migrate	out	of	the	disc.	This	spiral	structure,	
maintained	by	this	dynamic	friction	with	the	surrounding	negative	mass,	will	then	continue	
without	time	limit.	
						At	the	same	time	fusion	phenomena	will	enrich	these	formations.	These	capture	
phenomena	remain	non-collisional.	Thus	a	small	galaxy,	falling	into	this	potential	well	
constituted	by	the	galaxy	which	absorbs	it,	will	modify	the	local	distribution	of	the	
gravitational	field.	The	Janus	Cosmological	Model	(JCM)	offers	possibilities	for	many	
developments.	The	mechanism	of	the	gravitational	instability	of	Jeans	must	then	be	
integrated	into	a	scheme	of	joint	gravitational	instabilities	[11].	JCM	also	offers	the	first	

	
14	
mathematical	model	of	galaxies	as	a	self-gravitating	point-mass	system	described	by	a	
system	of	two	Vlasov	equations,	coupled	by	the	Poisson	equation	([12],[13],[27]).	The	two	
entities	are	then	described	by	an	elliptical	solution	of	the	Vlasov	equation,	an	extension	of	
the	classic	Maxwell-Boltzmann	solution	and	an	extension	of	the	work	of	S.Chandrasekhar	
[14].	This	theoretical	description	is	then	the	only	one	that	accounts	for	the	existence	of	a	
velocity	ellipsoid	within	the	galaxy,	whose	major	axis	points,	in	systems	obeying	the	O(2)	
symmetry,	towards	the	center	of	the	system.	
	7	–	JCM	and	dynamic	groups.	
 					The	theory	of	dynamic	groups	was	presented	and	developed	by	the	French	mathematician	
Jean-Marie	Souriau	[15].	The	isometry	group,	of	Minkowski	space,	the	Poincaré	group,	is	the	
dynamic	group	associated	with	it.	The	action	of	the	group	on	the	dual	of	its	Lie	algebra	
makes	it	possible	to	reveal	the	classical	objects	of	relativistic	physics,	energy,	momentum,	
spin,	as	components	of	the	space	of	the	moment.	The	Janus	model	is	presented	as	an	
extension	of	this	group	structure	by	integrating	the	antichronal	components	of	the	Poincaré	
group.	This	then	generates	the	movements	of	masses	and	particles	of	negative	energy.	The	
Janus	group	([16],	[2],	[18])	achieves	a	further	extension	with	the	addition	of	a	fifth	
dimension.	The	additional	scalar	arising	from	E.	Noether's	theorem	is	the	electric	charge	
[19].	This	group	translates	the	CPT	symmetry	of	the	model.	
 	(37)																																		
					Lo	is	the	element	of	the	orthochrone	subgroup	of	the	Lorentz	group.	C	is	the	space-time	
translation	vector.	The	action	of	the	group	on	the	dual	of	its	Lie	algebra	is:	
		(38)																																																																	 q = λµq'	
(39)																																							 M = Lo M'Lo
(40)																																																															 P' = λLo P							
					P	is	the	momentum-energy	4-vector.	M	is	an	antisymmetric	matrix	including	the	spin	
vector.	Here	is	the	classification	of	the	components	according	to	their	movements:	
	
-	 ( λ = −1 ; µ = 1)results	in	a	PT-symmetry	plus	a	C-symmetry	.	One	thus	obtains	
the	movement	of	a	particle	of	negative	mass.		
-	 ( λ = 1 ; µ = −1)operates	a	C-symmetry.	The	movement	obtained	is	that	of	an	
antiparticle	in	the	sense	of	Dirac,	of	positive	mass.		
																		-	 ( λ − = 1 ; µ = −1)represents	a	PT-symmetry.	The	motion	is	that	of	an	
antiparticle	of	negative	mass	(antiparticle	in	the	sense	of	Feynmann).

					This	structure	includes	the	matter-antimatter	duality	in	the	negative	mass	sector.	So	there	
are	two	antimatters.	This	study	concludes	that	the	antimatter,	of	positive	mass,	created	in	
the	experiments	carried	out	at	CERN	will	react	like	ordinary	matter	under	the	action	of	the	
Earth's	gravitational	field,	which	seems	to	confirm	the	first	experimental	results.	
8	–	JCM	and	the	paradox	of	primordial	antimatter.	
 					The	Russian	Andréi	Sakharov	is	the	only	one	to	have	proposed	an	explanation	for	the	
absence	of	observation	of	primordial	antimatter	and	locating	it	in	a	Twin	universe,	linked	to	
our	own	universe	sheet	by	a	CPT-symmetry.	The	Janus	model	concretizes	his	idea.	([20]	
,[21],	[22]).	In	this	view	the	mass	and	negative	energy	side	contains	antimatter	of	negative	
mass,	an	excess	of	quarks	of	negative	energy	in	a	ratio	of	3	to	1,	and	photons	of	negative	
energy	resulting	from	the	primordial	annihilation	in	the	world.	negative.	
	9	–	JCM	and	the	nature	of	the	invisible	components	of	the	universe.					
						This	antimatter	consists	of	negative	mass	antihydrogen	and	antihelium.	These	atoms	are	
gathered	in	immense	spheroidal	conglomerates.	Their	cooling	time	being	greater	than	the	
age	of	the	universe,	they	do	not	evolve	and	do	not	generate	galaxies,	stars	or	planets.	Life	is	
absent	from	this	negative	sector.	The	Janus	model	is	the	only	one	to	offer	an	accurate	and	
detailed	description	of	the	invisible	components	of	the	universe.		10	–	The	JCM	model	and	
quantum	mechanics.					Since	its	appearance,	quantum	field	theory	[23]	has	been	based	on	
the	supposed	non-existence	of	negative	energy	states	by	opting	for	a	priori	choices	
concerning	the	nature	of	the	essential	operators	P	and	T.	P	has	thus	been	considered	as	a	
linear	and	unitary	operator,	whereas	the	time	inversion	operator	T	was	on	the	contrary	
endowed	with	the	qualifiers	of	antiunitary	and	antilinear.	The	acceleration	of	cosmic	
expansion	involves	the	action	of	negative	pressure.	A	pressure	being	a	volumic	density	of	
energy,	this	discovery	imposes	a	return	on	these	hypotheses,	introduced	to	oppose	the	
emergence	of	states	of	negative	energy.	The	mathematician	Nathalie	Debergh	([24],[25])	has	
shown	that	the	equations	of	Dirac	and	Schrödinger	generate	states	of	negative	energy	
provided	that	we	remove	this	constraint	posed	a	priori,	concerning	the	nature	of	the	
operator	T.		
 					In	addition,	we	think	that	the	integration	of	negative	masses	could	be	the	key	to	the	
quantification	of	gravitation.			
		11	–	JCM	and	the	homogeneity	of	the	primitive	universe.			
				Since	1988	([26],	[2])	a	representation	of	cosmic	evolution	with	a	set	of	variable	constants,	
associated	with	scale	and	time	factors	has	provided	an	alternative	interpretation	to	the	
theory	of	inflation,	concerning	the	homogeneity	of	the	primitive	universe.	This	approach	has	
been	extended	to	a	bimetric	structure	(28).	These	regimes	with	variable	constants	end	as	
soon	as	the	average	distance	between	the	masses	becomes	greater	than	their	Compton	
length,	i.e.	upstream	of	the	evolutions	corresponding	to	entities	dominated	by	radiation.

12	–	JCM	and	CMB	fluctuations.			
						The	JCM	provides	its	own	interpretation	of	the	CMB	fluctuations	by	attributing	them	to	
the	response	of	the	positive	world	to	the	density	fluctuations	of	the	adjacent	universe	cells,	
related	to	the	gravitational	instability	that	manifests	within	them.	The	analysis	of	these	
fluctuations	is	presented	as	a	means	of	evaluating	the	ratio	of	the	scale	factors	of	the	two	
entities.	We	find	that	a(+)/a(-)	is	of	the	order	of	100.	We	deduce	that	c(-)/c(+)	would	be	of	the	
order	of	10.	The	overall	effect	would	be	to	reduce	the	time	interstellar	travel	by	a	thousand	
factor,	for	vehicles	managing	to	invert	their	mass	to	be	able	to	travel	by	using	the	geodesics	
resulting	from	the	metric	
( − ).

	1	–	Building	the	dynamical	group.		
				Since	the	work	of	the	French	mathematician	Jean-Marie	Souriau	[24]	we	know	that	the	
dynamic	groups	of	physics	make	it	possible	to	construct	the	parameters	which	characterize	
the	contents	as	objects	of	pure	geometry.	If	we	start	with	special	relativity,	its	dynamical	
group	is	the	isometry	group	of	Minkowski	space.	This	is	defined	by	its	metric	matrix,	a	
Gramm	matrix:	
 	(1)																																																							
					The	Lorentz	group,	of	dimension	6,	is	then	axiomatically	defined	by:	
 	(2)																																																																				 Lt G L = G		
					C	being	the	space-time	translation	four-vector:	
		
 	(3)																																																																			
							The	isometry	group	is	the		Poincaré	group:		
⎠⎟		
(4)																																																																								
					What	lives	in	Minkowski	space	are	movements.	The	elements	of	the	group	allow	you	to	
pass	from	one	movement	to	another	movement.	But,	from	then	on,	a	singular	situation	
emerges.	The	Lorentz	group	is	composed	of	four	connected	components.	
à   L n  , neutral	component,	does	not	invert	space	or	time.	
à		 L s	,	inverts	space:	P-symmetry.	
à L t	,	inverts	time,	but	no	space:	T-	symmetry	
L st	inverts	both	space	and	time:	PT-	symmetry

we	see	that	we	can	reconstitute	the	whole	group	by	writing:

including	set	of	time-reversing	components.	We	could	thus,	in	the	same	way,	write	the	
complete	Poincaré	group:	
	(8)	
λ = ±1	
						Since	1970	the	mathematician	J-M	Souriau	has	shown	how	the	action	of	this	dynamic	
group	on	the	dual	of	its	Lie	algebra	made	it	possible	to	reveal	the	relativistic	components	of	
movements	[24].	This	action	on	the	space	of	moments	is	given	in	equations	(13.107):	
	
		
				The	result	corresponds	to	equations	(14.67)	where	Is	and	It	represent	the	spatial	and	
temporal	inversions:

Equation	 (14.67)	 shows	 that	 time	 reversal	 	 changes	 the	 sign	 of	 energy	 and	
thus	 the	 signe	 of	 the	 mass.	 Consequently	 it	 transforms	 	 every	 motion	 of	 a	
particle	of	mass	m	into	a	motion	of	particle	–m.		

						In	the	Janus	model,	particles	of	negative	mass	and	photons	of	negative	energy	are	given	a	
physical	meaning,	which	is	equivalent	to	associating	Minkowski	space	with	its	complete	
isometry	group.	
		2	–	Extended	group.	Antimatter	and	geometry.		
					We	are	going	to	make	the	group	act	on	a	five-dimensional	Kaluza	space,	by	adding	a	fifth	
dimension	ζ,	of	the	space	type.	This	action	is	limited	to	a	translation	of	a	quantity	 φ	.	We	
could,	without	doing	any	calculation,	say	straight	away,	according	to	Noether's	theorem,	that	
this	new	symmetry	entails	the	conservation	of	a	scalar,	which	will	be	the	electric	charge	q.	
Let	us	introduce	this	extension	of	the	group	in	the	following	form:

					The		element	of	its	Lie	algebra	is	then:

				For	computational	convenience,	we	write	the	action	of	the	group	on	its	Lie	algebra	
 Z' = a −1 Z a	instead	of		 Z' = a Z a −1,	which	is	equivalent	to	computing	the	action	of	the	inverse	
of	the	element	of	the	group	on	the	element	of	its	Lie	algebra,	but	the	result	will	be	equivalent	
since	the	set	of	inverses	also	represents	the	group.	It	comes	:		
	
(13)																																		
which	gives	:		
(14)	
					We	are	looking	for	the	dual	of	the	group's	action	on	its	Lie	algebra.	The	element	of	this	Lie	
algebra	depends	on	11	parameters.		
	(15)																												 
				The	moment	space	of	the	group	will	thus	be	a	vector	space	of	dimension	11.	It	can	be	put	
in	the	form	of	an	antisymmetric	matrix	M	of	format	(4,4),	depending	on	six	parameters,	a

				Equations	(54),(55),(56)	represent	an	extension	of	equations	13.107	of	reference	[27].	The	
relation	(57)	makes	it	possible	to	find	Souriau's	relation	([24]	page	190,	equations	14.67	).	
!p	.															
The	inversion	of	time	 ( λ= −1)	leads	to	the	inversion	of	energy	and	of	the	impulse	vector	  
The	matrix	M	depending	on	six	parameters	can	be	decomposed	into	two	vectors.	The	vector	
f	is	what	Souriau	calls	the	passage	and	s	is	the	spin.	
	(31)
																																														 
				The	passage	f	is	not	an	intrinsic	attribute	of	the	motion	because	it	can	be	cancelled	by	a	
change	of	variable	accompanying	the	particle.	Only	the	spin	remains,	of	which	Souriau	
demonstrated	in	1970	its	geometrical	nature.	By	cancelling	the	spatio-temporal	translation	C	
the	relation	(53),	where	λ		then	does	not	appear,	shows	that	the	inversion	of	time	does	not	
modify	the	spin	vector.	With	this	way	of	carrying	out	the	calculation	one	obtains	the	result	of	
}gives	
the	action	of	the	group	on	a	movement,	characterized	by	the	quantities	
another	movement	
}.	It	is	the	relation	(54)	which	informs	on	the	fact	that	starting	
from	a	motion	representing	that	of	a	particle	of	matter	:		
	
-	 ( λ = −1 ; µ = 1)results	in	a	PT-symmetry	plus	a	C-symmetry	.	One	thus	obtains	the	
movement	of	a	particle	of	negative	mass.		
	-	 ( λ = 1 ; µ = −1)operates	a	C-symmetry.	The	movement	obtained	is	that	of	an	
antiparticle	in	the	sense	of	Dirac,	of	positive	mass.		
	-	 ( λ − = 1 ; µ = −1)represents	a	PT-symmetry.	The	motion	is	that	of	an	antiparticle	of	
negative	mass	(antiparticle	in	the	sense	of	Feynmann).		
				As	is	known	experiments	were	conducted	at	CERN	aimed	at	determining	the	behavior	of	
antimatter	particles	in	the	gravitational	field	of	the	Earth.	In	accordance	with	what	has	just	
been	exposed,	the	antimatter	produced	in	the	laboratory	has	a	positive	mass	and	behaves,	in	
the	gravitational	field	of	the	Earth,	like	ordinary	masses.	Indeed	this	is	what	emerged	from	
the	experiments.  
 		3	–	Could	the	Janus	model	be	just	part	of	a	higher	dimensional	space? 
 					From	a	geometrical	context	which	is	the	Minkowski	space	it	was	possible	to	build	
contents	of	mass	and	positive	and	negative	energy.		One	can	consider	that	this	Minkowski	
space		to	be	only	a	sub-space	of	the	complex	structure	that	is	Hermite's	space.		In	such	a

					and	the	line	element:		
(33)																																									 ds2 = (dX°)* dX° − (dX1)* dX1 − (dX2)* dX2 − (dX3)* dX3	
					The	corresponding	isometry	group	is	built	in	a	similar	way,	and	is	built	from	the	complex	
Lotentz	group,	as	defined	by	:

We	form	the	element	of	its	Lie	algebra

				It	is	easy	to	show	that	 Ωis	an	antihermitian	matrix.	As	in	the	real	case	we	will	form	the	
action	of	the	group	on	its	Lie	algebra:	
(37)																																																																 Z' = A−1 Z A

					We	will	link	this	geometric	description	to	the	movements	of	particles	in	a	complex	space.

					All	configurations	are	possible.	
					We	can	imagine	particles	whose	movements	are	belong	to	the	real	plane.	These	will	then	
correspond	to	the	movements	of	real	masses	m.	As	I	used	the	letter	M	to	describe	a	
component	of	the	moment	I	will	have	to	use	another	character	 M,	italic,	to	describe	a	
complex	mass,	with	the	idea	that	uppercase	characters	correspond	to	complex	quantities:	
:		(68)																																																																						  M = m + iµ	
				We	will	have	“real	masses	m”	whose	movements	are	part	of	the	real	plane	and	which	“live”	
at	the	rate	of	time	t.	And	“Imaginary	masses	 µ  ”	whose	movements	are	part	of	the	
imaginary	plane	and	which	live	with	imaginary	time	 τ.			
					And	“complex	masses	  M = m + iµ” whose	movements	are	part	of	the	complex	space	
 X = x + iξ  and	which	“live”	with	a	complex	time	  T = t + i τ.			
					Finally	we	can	imagine	semi-complex	movements,	where	the	movement	is	managed	in:	
	(69)																																																																										  x ,τ{

					Combination	of	real	space	and	imaginary	time.	Or		a	combination	of	imaginary	space	and

(71)																																								 
					Like	Souriau,	we	begin	by	operating	a	circular	permutation	in	the	first	term	of	the	second	
member:	
	(72)																																																		 Tr( M'L *ΩL) = Tr( LM'L *Ω)																																								
	Whiche	gives:		
(73)																																							
					The	term				 P * L * Ω C			is	formed	by	the	product	of	two	complex	vectors,	the	line	vector	 P *	,	
and	the	column	vector	 L * Ω C	
					So	that	we	can	write	:		
(74)																																												 P * L * Ω C = Tr( L * Ω C P * )	
	And	still	operate	another	circular	permutation;	
	(75)																																																				 P * L * Ω C = Tr( C P *L *Ω )	
	
				Which	gives:		
(76)																																			
Tr( LM'L *Ω) + Tr( C P'*L * Ω )	
				Inverting	the		‘	:		
(77)																																			 Tr( M'Ω) = Tr( LM L *Ω) + 2Tr( C P *L * Ω )	
		(78)																																			 
						We	thus	finally	obtain	the	equivalent,	in	complexes,	of	the	relations	established	by	Souriau
