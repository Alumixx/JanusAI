	Sir,	More	than	three	months	have	passed	since	my	letter	of	26	September	2019,	which	
remained	unanswered.	A	letter	that	included	all	the	elements	of	a	reply	to	the	article	
that	you	posted	on	January	7,	2019	on	your	page	of	the	IHES	site,	which	concluded	"to	
the	physical	and	mathematical	incoherence	of	the	Janus	model",	based	on	the	difficulty	
of	describing	the	geometry	inside	the	stars.		
I	brought	all	the	elements	that	put	this	model	back	on	its	foundations	at	the	price	of	a	
minimal	modification	of	the	tensors	of	the	second	member,	which	ensures	the	
satisfaction	 of	 Bianchi's	
identities,	 without	 changing	 anything	 to	 the	 model's	
achievements,	namely	the	satisfaction	of	about	ten	sets	of	observational	data.	This	work	
was	published	in	March	2019	in	the	journal	Progress	in	Physics.			
http://www.jp-petit.org/papers/cosmo/2019-Progress-in-Physics-1.pdf	
I	immediately	asked	you	to	put	a	link	on	your	page	to	what	can	be	considered	a	scientific	
right	of	reply.		
No	answer	
Thinking	that	you	had	probably	not	read	this	article,	I	composed	a	detailed	forty-page	
presentation	of	its	contents,	with	all	the	calculation	details,	which	I	forwarded	to	you	on	
September	26,	with	the	same	request.		
No	response.

I	am	rephrasing	this	request	for	the	last	time.	If	you	do	not	reply,	I	will	then	take	all	
necessary	steps	to	denounce	this	serious	breach	of	scientific	ethics	and	the	resulting	
damage	to	my	reputation	as	a	scientist.		
Yours	sincerely	
Jean-Pierre	Petit

Appendix	1:	Calculation	details	
Appendix	2:	the	English	translation	of	your	article.	
	Sir,	On	January	4,	2019,	you	placed	an	article	[1]	on	your	page	of	the	IHES	website	entitled	:		
Where	you	point	out	"the	physical	and	mathematical	inconsistency	of	our	model".	I	
replied	in	a	simple	letter,	drawing	your	attention	to	an	article	of	mine[2]	that	appeared	
in	the	journal	Progress	in	Physics	(attachment),	entitled	:	
Progress	in	Physics	2019	Vol.15	issue	1	
which,	while	agreeing	on	the	relevance	of	your	criticism	brings	the	solution	to	the	
problem,	modulo	a	very	slight	modification	of	the	system	of	Janus	field	equations	which	
in	no	way	invalidates	everything	that	had	already	been	obtained	and	published	as	
results	and	many	agreements	with	the	observational	results.		
I	had	asked	you,	in	a	simple	letter,	either	to	include	the	content	of	this	article	on	this	
page,	or	simply	the	address	where	it	is	accessible,	as	a	legitimate	right	of	scientific	reply,	

Physical	and	mathematical	consistency	of	the	Janus	Cosmological	Model

even	if	you	might	formulate	new	criticisms	on	this	paper,	in	order	to	maintain	your	
negative	opinion	of	our	approach.	This	is	part	of	the	normal	game	of	scientific	activity.					
But	I	believe	that	you	have	not	read	it,	and	in	any	case	have	not	taken	seriously	the	
arguments	that	were	developed	in	it.	It	is	a	pity,	because	in	doing	so	"you	are	throwing	
the	baby	out	with	the	bath	water"	at	a	time	of	crisis	in	cosmology	and	astrophysics	when	
the	examination	of	new	ideas	would	be,	it	seems	to	me,	opportune.	
We	have	received	several	letters	from	foreign	researchers	who,	having	been	informed	of	
the	presence	of	your	review	on	your	IHES	page,	have	translated	this	text	into	English	
and	Russian,	and	were	surprised	not	to	see	any	links	to	a	possible	right	of	reply.	A	
colleague	also	informs	me	that	your	colleague	Marc	Lachièze-Rey	tells	anyone	who	
wants	to	hear	it	"that	Damour	has	shown	that	the	Janus	model	does	not	make	sense".	
I	am	therefore	republishing	my	approach,	this	time	by	registered	mail	with	
acknowledgement	of	receipt,	once	again	attaching	the	content	of	my	article.	But	as	I	am	
not	sure	you	will	read	this	document,	I	will	summarize	it.	
The	first	members	of	your	own	system	of	coupled	field	equations	[13]	are	identical	to	
those	in	Sabine	Hossenfelder's	2008	paper	[3]	and	to	our	2014	system	of	equations	[4].	
The	common	denominator	being	to	choose	to	include	the	Lagrangian	densities	
  − g(+) R(+)and  − g(−) R(−)	(noted	by	you	"right"	and	"left")	in	the	action	integral,	
which	immediately	produces	this	form	

with	the	Lagrangian	

	

	
With	"Janus"	notations,	by	opting	for	a	nullity	of	the	two	cosmological	constants	and	by	
taking	 χ= 1		this	can	be	written	:

In	the	second	members	the	sources	of	the	fields	determining	the	geometries	of	the

The	"Janus"	writing	convention	is	translated	as	:

(4)																																																															
	
The	form	of	the	first	two	members	then	requires	that	the	differences	of	the	second	
two	members	be	null	and	void.		
In	order	to	demonstrate	the	inconsistency	of	the	Janus	system	you	choose	to	opt	for	
the	:		
-	Stationary	situation	
-	Presence	of	a	positive	mass,	of	constant	density,	located	inside	a	sphere	(that	is	to	
say,	schematically,	a	"star").	
-	Zero	negative	material	density	("left").		
The	system	then	becomes,	with	your	notations	:	
(5)																																																							
(+)		
(−)	
(6)																																																							
It	should	be	noted	at	this	stage	that	there	is	no	definition	of	how	the	tensor	
(−)should	be	
constructed.	It	is	the	effect	of	"induced	geometry"	created	in	the	"left"	sector	by	the	
"right"	material.	All	that	could	be	said	is	that	this	tensor	should	be	a	function	of	the	
"right"	content,	i.e.

The	proposal	of	the	"Janus"	model	amounted	to	giving	this	term	the	form	:		
(8)																																																										
(+)		
To	show	that	the	inconsistency	appears	even	in	an	almost	Lorentian	situation,	in	your	
(+)	according	to	:	
article,	page	2,	equation	(5)	you	introduce	a	tensor	
(+)	
	(9)																																																						
The	conditions	of	zero	divergence	of	the	two	equations	are	then	written	(your	equations	
(7)	and	(8),	page	3	of	your	article)	:	
(+) = 0		
(10)																																																																							
(11)																																																																							
(+) = 0		
(+)	
Where	the	operators	 ∇ν(+)and	 ∇ν(+)are	constructed	from	the	two	different	metrics
and	
(−).		
What	is	the	physical	meaning	of	these	zero	divergence	conditions?	These	are	
conservation	equations.	It	is	therefore	not	surprising	that	equations	(10)	and	(11)	lead	
to	Euler-type	equations,	which	express	the	fact	that,	in	the	star,	the	force	of	gravity	
balances	the	force	of	pressure.		
The	calculation	leads	to	:		
	(12)																																																																														 ∂ip(+) = + ρ(+) ∂iU		
(13)																																																																															 ∂ip(+) = − ρ(+) ∂iU	
Equations	which,	as	you	rightly	point	out,	contradict	each	other.		
Let's	now	go	back	to	physics	by	deciding	to	write	the	Janus	equations	in	their	mixed	
form:

We	are	going	to	consider	modifying	the	system	of	Janus	coupled	field	equations	as

νand	
the	mathematical	imperatives	of	zero	divergence	that	we	have	pointed	out,	and	which	
we	cannot	escape.

At	this	point,	someone	might	say:		

	
10	
-	That's	very	clever.	To	make	this	difficulty	disappear	Petit	has	tinkered	with	the	tensors	
present	in	the	second	limbs	so	that	the	inconsistency	linked	to	the	emergence	of	Euler's	
equation,	translating	the	balance	between	the	forces	of	pressure	and	gravity	into	the	
masses,	disappears	.		
But,	as	we	have	pointed	out,	the	incoherence	linked	to	the	emergence	of	the	Euler	
equation,	which	reflects	the	balance	between	the	forces	of	pressure	and	gravity	in	the	
masses,	will	disappear.	
(+)	and	
	what	determined	the	shape	of	the	tensors	
(−)	responsible	for	the	induced	
geometry	effects?	Here,	using	your	formulation:			
(+)		
(31)																																																	
(−)	
(32)																																																		
In	the	Newtonian	approximation	(linearization)	the	effect	of	pressure	is	neglected	in	
relation	to	the	density	term	 ( p << ρc2 ).	By	saying	that	this	system	will	only	be	valid	for	
linearized	solutions,	it	provides	about	ten	results	in	agreement	with	the	observations.		
In	this	linearization	viewpoint	we	will	have	tensors	in	the	form	:	
	(33)																		
The	three	diagonal	terms	being	finally	neglected.		
How	then	to	complete	these	tensors	by	adding	these	missing	diagonal	terms?		
Answer	(from	physicist):	by	making	sure	that	the	Euler	equations	(equilibrium,	in	
regions	where	masses	are	present,	between	the	force	of	gravity	and	the	force	of	
pressure)	are	satisfied.	This	is	equivalent	to	wishing	that	the	equations	satisfy	
(asymptotically)	the	Bianchi	conditions.		
This	leads	to	the	choice	(26)	+	(27).		
This	is	the	answer	I	gave	you	in	this	article	published	in	Progress	in	Physics,	which	you	
probably	haven't	read.

I	saw	that	Nathalie	Deruelle	had	been	your	adviser	in	the	making	of	your	article.	I	
proposed	to	you	and	to	her	a	meeting	in	a	room	with	a	blackboard,	without	witnesses	or	
recording,	which	would	allow	me	to	expose	this	work	and	answer	your	questions.	
Neither	of	you	had	the	simple	courtesy	of	simply	answering	me.	
The	text,	which	still	appears	on	your	IHES	page,	discredits	me	as	a	scientist,	not	only	
with	French	people,	but	within	the	entire	international	scientific	community.	You	can	of	
course	choose	not	to	subscribe	to	my	requests.	In	this	case,	what	I	can	tell	you	is	that,	
failing	to	obtain	a	legitimate	debate	with	the	people	who	are	supposed	to	be	specialists	
in	these	matters,	this	whole	affair	will	ultimately	be	brought	to	the	attention	of	the	
greatest	number,	in	French	and	in	English,	via	one	or	more	videos,	with	all	the	details	of	
the	calculations	provided	in	attached	pdf	files.	
A	new	situation	is	emerging.	Through	the	series	of	about	thirty	Janus	videos,	using	my	
talents	as	a	teacher,	I	have	exposed	all	the	ins	and	outs	of	the	approach	we	have	
undertaken	for	so	many	years,	underlining	in	passing	the	contradictions	in	which	
contemporary	cosmology	and	astrophysics	are	sinking	deeper	and	deeper,	by	resorting	
to	the	undefined	concepts	of	dark	matter	and	dark	energy.			
You	are	the	only	one	to	have	reacted	in	a	constructed	and	argued	way	through	the	
article	that	you	have	positioned	in	your	page	of	the	IHES	and	we	are	grateful	to	you	for	
that.	
Everyone	knows	that	models	don't	come	into	being	all	at	once,	in	their	most	elaborate	
form.	Your	comment	therefore	prompted	a	necessary	reworking	of	the	model,	with	
publication	in	a	peer-reviewed	journal	(which	was	in	progress	at	the	time).	This	is	a	
purely	mathematical	reworking,	which,	by	the	way,	does	not	in	any	way	change	the	
results	already	obtained	and	published	and	the	many	points	of	agreement	with	the	
observations.	From	this	point	of	view,	we	can	only	be	grateful	to	you	for	having	
highlighted	this	shortcoming	and	for	having	prompted	this	progress.	
-	I	therefore	request	that	you	add	the	contents	of	this	letter	to	this	page	of	the	IHES,	as	
an	exercise	of	my	scientific	right	of	reply.	Even	if	you	put	forward	any	arguments	that	
contradict	my	arguments.		
Unless	you	would	prefer	to	put	this	link	on	your	page	of	the	IHES	site	/		
	-	I	ask	you	to	put	the	link	to	my	progress	in	physics	article:		
	-	I	ask	you	to	put	a	link	to	the	translation	of	your	own	article	in	English,	through	the	link:		
Or	to	reproduce	this	text	in	your	page	of	the	IHES	website.		
	-	Insofar	as	we	have	responded	to	your	legitimate	objection,	it	would	be	appropriate	for	
us	to	be	able	to	present	this	work,	"revisited",	in	a	seminar	at	the	IHES,	and	I	am	
rephrasing	this	request	to	you.

Figure	:	Thee	Great	Repeller	

		
As	suggested	as	early	as	1995	years	these	negative	mass	conglomerates	create	a	
negative	gravitational	lens	effect	which	has	the	effect	of	reducing	the	brightness	of	
distant,	background	sources.	Effect	which,	according	to	us,	explains	the	low	magnitude	
of	galaxies	at	z	>	7.		
This	being	the	case,	a	fine	analysis	of	the	magnitudes	of	the	distant	sources	located	in	the	
direction	of	the	Great	Repeller	should	provide	access	to	the	diameter	of	this	negative	
mass	conglomerate,	which	is	invisible	since	it	emits	negative	energy	photons.	
	
-  So	we	have	a	system	of	two	Janus	coupled	field	equations,	whose	scope	is	
limited	to	linearized,	quasi-Newtonian	solutions.		
-	Which	derives	from	an	action	
-	That	satisfies	Bianchi's	identities	
-	Which	takes	care	of	all	the	classic	situations	of	the	RG	
-	It's	an	advantageous	substitute	for	dark	matter	and	dark	energy.		
-	Fits	a	dozen	or	so	observational	data.	

In	spite	of	the	progress	represented	by	the	first	evidence	of	the	existence	of	gravitational	
waves,	cosmology	suffers	from	not	being	able	to	highlight	the	hypothetical	dark	matter	
nor	being	able	to	provide	any	model	for	this	other	component	represented	by	this	no	
less	hypothetical	dark	energy.		
The	Janus	model	is	the	only	one	to	provide	a	well-founded	description	of	the	nature	of	
these	invisible	components	of	the	cosmos,	namely	antimatter	(antihydrogen	of	negative	
mass).	The	model	explains	in	passing	the	non-observation	of	primordial	antimatter,	

To	sum	up	:

giving	substance	to	André	Sakharov's	initial	1967	idea.	It	is	consistent	with	a	good	dozen	
observational	data	sets.

the	last	five	years.	In	your	registered	letter	of	7	January	2019,	you	confirmed	your	
refusal	to	see	me	present	this	work	to	the	IHES.	I	am	rephrasing	this	request	once	again	
in	the	hope	that	my	letter	will	have	made	you	change	your	mind.		
I	also	ask	you	to	reproduce	these	clarifications	on	the	Janus	model	in	both	languages,	
French	and	English,	accompanying	the	English	translation	of	your	own	article,	which	I	
have	attached.		My	foreign	colleagues	are	waiting	to	read	the	criticisms/responses	in	
order	to	be	able	to	form	their	own	opinion	on	this	model.		
If	there	is	no	real	debate	on	these	issues	a	situation	will	continue	to	develop	where	
finally	non-specialists	end	up	having	a	clearer	global	vision	than	specialists,	the	attitude	
of	a	man	like	Lachièze-Rey	being	an	example	of	this	irrational	and	absurd	deafness.

We	hope	that	this	mailing	will	help	to	clean	up	this	situation,	which	is	in	urgent	need.

This	contains	all	the	calculations	(oh	so	tedious,	as	is	always	the	
case	
in	 differential	 geometry)	 that	 support	 the	 reasoning	
presented	in	the	body	of	the	article.		
	As	a	general	rule	we	are	in	the	case	of	a	spherically	symmetrical	geometry.		
In	this	case	the	two	metrics	are	written	as	follows:

(1)																														 
(2)																															
		In	the	following,	to	lighten	the	writing,	we	will	ask:				
(−) ≡ gµν	
(−) ≡ Rµν	
R(−) = R	
(−) ≡ Eµν	
ρ(−) = ρ	
(−) = gµν		
ν(−) =ν ; λ(−) = λ

We	will	perform	the	calculations	starting	from	an	expression	of	the	field	equations	
presented	in	mixed	form	:

We	will	then	opt	for	the	configuration	envisaged	by	Damour,	considering	a	part	of	the

-	The	first	equation	can	then	be	identified	with	Einstein's	equation	without	
cosmological	constants.		
-	The	second	equation	translates	an	"induced	geometry	effect"	(on	geodesics	of	the	
negative	mass	species,	due	to	the	presence	of	positive	mass	inside	a	sphere	of	
radius,	density	 ρ(+) = ρ	
We	will	try	to	stick	with	the	notations	used	by	T.	Damour	[1]	in	his	paper.	He	writes	our	
system	(5)	+	(6)	according	to	his	equation	(4),	page	1	:

then	he	asks	(his	equation	(4)	)

	This	leads	him	to	write	the	system	of	equations	(his	equations	(6)):	
		
And	then	we	get	to	the	source	of	his	critique	of	the	two-equation	system.	Indeed,	the	
structure	of	the	first	members	imposes	that	:	
(7)

 ∇ν Eµν = 0

Therefore	we	must	have	the	conservation	laws	(his	equations	(7)	and	(8)	on	page	3	of	
his	paper):

We	will	resume	the	thread	of	its	calculation	at	the	end	of	this	Appendix	1.	Still,	by	giving	
the	tensor	the	form	corresponding	to	the	unmodified	Janus	equations,	equations	(9)	and	
(10)	led	to	contradictory	Euler	equations	(equations	(32)	and	(33)	on	page	7	of	his	
paper).		
How	to	get	out	of	this	impasse?		
By	noticing	that	we	are	totally	free	in	the	choice	of	tensors	reflecting	the	effects	induced	
(by	a	material	on	the	material	of	opposite	sign).	As	we	will	show	by	taking	again	all	its	
calculation	by	the	menu,	a	light	modification	of	the	tensor	
Tµν	brings	the	solution,	
without	modifying	by	one	iota	all	the	aspects	related	to	the	solutions	emerging	from	the	
two	coupled	equations	("interior"	metrics,	that	is	to	say	inside	the	star	and	"exterior"	
metrics,	outside	the	star).		
	When	we	start	to	calculate	the	exact	solution	of	this	system,	if	we	do	not	take	this	
precaution,	we	would	also	see	this	kind	of	contradiction,	inside	the	star,	in	the	form	of	
the	emergence	of	two	equations	of	the	Tolmann	Oppenheimer	Volkoff	type,	which	are	
also	contradictory.	In	what	will	follow,	which	translates	the	construction	of	the	two	
metrics	as	a	whole,	modulo	this	precaution,	this	problem	will	not	appear.	But	to	
convince	the	reader,	we	will	take	up	this	whole	scheme	according	to	the	approach	
followed	by	Damour	[1]	.		
Below	is	the	calculation	of	the	components	of	the	Ricci	tensor	and	the	first	limb,	for	the	
positive	species.		
We	have	:

To	be	ompared	with	what	emerged	from	the	analysis	for	positive	masses,	i.e.	equation	
(43):	
These	differential	equations	are	not	identical,	unless	the	Newtonian	approximation	is	
used,	then	they	lead	to	the	same	result		
	(85)	:																																																														
Which	is	equivalent	to		(32)	:					
The	physical	and	mathematical	inconsistency	of	the	model	disappears.	One	could	object	
that	this	limits	the	solutions	to	those	that	fit	this	Newtonian	approximation.	But	in	
cosmology,	what	more	do	you	ask	for?		
Better	a	model	that	provides	calculation	results	limited	to	the	conditions	of	the	
Newtonian	approximation	(i.e.	to	all	the	data	available	observationally)	than	an	
extremely	ambitious	model	(Damour	and	Kogan	2001)	that	promises	us	non-linear	
solutions	but	which,	in	the	end,	does	not	offer	a	possible	confrontation	with	the	
observations.		
We	are	going	to	finalize	the	calculation	of	the	inner	metric	of	the	negative	species,	as	we	
did	earlier.	We	will	not	omit	any	intermediary	of	calculation	to	be	sure	that	an	error	(it	
happened	quickly)	will	not	slip	into	the	process.

The	«	Janus	Cosmological	Model	»	is	physically	(and	mathematically	)	unconsistent

The	classical	definition	of

The	«	Janus	Model	»	does	not	fit	the	Bianchi	identities.	In	effect	the	system	(1a)	+	(1b)

Now	consider	the	two	conservation	laws	(5a)	and	(5b).		
Let	us	first	concentrate	on	the	movement	of	the	test	dust	matter.	The	laws	(5a)	and	(5b)	
the	following	constrainst	:		
(10)																																																																							
 ∇µ uµ = 0	
 ∇µ (ρ1uµ) = 0

 ∇µ uµ = 0

	The	physical	meaning	of	the	equation	(10)	is	the	following.	It	shows	that	the	lines	of	the	
universe	of	the	matter	(defined	by	 uµ = gµνuν	)	are	geodesics	of	
(+)	,	while	the	
third	equation	(12)	says	that	the	same	positive	matter	is	also	ruled	(by	the	equations	
 "−"	)	to	obey	another	equations	of	the	movement		
 ∇µ uµ = 0	which	shows	that	the	line	
of	the	universe	defined	by	 uµ = gµν uν	must	be	geodesics	derived	from	the	
metric.	But	the	4-velocity	field	 uµ	is	not	independent	of		 uµ.	Considered	as	a	covariant

field	it	is	basically	the	same	through	a	renormalization	factor	 uµ = uµ / N,	equation,	so	
(+)	and	
that	
(+)	are	a	
uµ = gµνuν / N = gµσ gσνuν / N.	As	the	two	metrics	
priori	different	I	don’t	see	how	it	could	be	possible	(	considering	a	complex	general	time	
gµν and gµν	)	to	have	the	same	
dependent	solution,	defined	by	arbitrary	Cauchy	data	for		
matter	following	different	motion	equations.	If	we	consider	for	example	some	initial	
velocity	data	for	a	a	test	dust,	such	velocity	would	be	supposed	to	folllow	at	the	same	
time	two	distinct	rules	of	evolution,	which	is	mathematically	absurd	for	a	classical	
theory	!	
			Another	physico-mathematical	contradiction	may	arise	from	equations	(4a)	and	(4b)	
applying	such	system	to	the	structure	of	a	self-gravitating	star,	in	Newtonian	limit.	
Consider	a	background	source	corresponding	to	a	perfect	fluid	:		
(13)																																									
o(+) = ( ρc2 + p ) uµuν + pgµν		
I	will	limit	the	analysis	to	the	almost	Newtonian	conditions.	I	will	show	that	this	theory	
is	self	contradictory	and	does	not	lead	to	any	physical	solution.		
I	recall	that	the	linearized	solution	of	the	Einstein	equations	may	be	written	:

(14)																																			
where	U	is	the	newtonian	potential	from	Poisson	equation	:

Due	to	the	formal	symmetry	of	the	system	(4a)	+	(4b)	we	get	the	corresponding
