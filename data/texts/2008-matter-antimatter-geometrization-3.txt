We  include  antichron elements in  the  dynamic  group.  Then  we  get  movements  and  moments involving T-symmetry, like  PT-
symmetric movements and CPT-symmetric movements. The first evoke the Feynmann's vision of antimatter and the second the so
calle "CPT theorem". But tim-inversion, from coadjoint action, changes the sign of the mass and energy. The PT-symmetrical of
a particle of matter does not longer identify to Dirac's antiparticle, as Feynmann thaught. It is an antiparticle, but with negative
mass.  Same  thing  for  CPT  theorem:  the  CPT-symmetrcal  of  a  particle of  a  particle  of  matter  is  a  partcle  of  matter,  but with
negative mass.

In former papers ([1] and [2]) we have given a geometrical interpretation of antimatter. Matter and antimatter are suppose to have
their personal playing field {ζ i > 0} and {ζ i < 0} in a ten dimensional space:

{ ζ 1 , ζ 2 , ζ 3 , ζ 4 , ζ 5 , ζ 6  , x , y , z , t }

composed by space-time { x , y z , t } plus six additional dimensions. The playing field of photons corresponds to the {ζ i > 0}
plane.

Our 16 dimension groups gives six additional scalars, identified to quantum charges. The basic geometric definition of antimatter
we suggest corresponds to:

ζ-symmetry: { ζ i} ----> {- ζ i}

Through a four component group  [2]  we  have  shown  that,  in such conditions, the ζ-symmetry goes  with  a C-symmetry, which
corresponds to Dirac's antimatter [3], [4] and [5].

Feynmann  suggested  an  alternative  description  of  antimatter.  The  argument  is  the  following.  If  we consider the evolution of a
particule owing a mass m and an impulsion p, its energy is:

Suppose that this particle, moving in the "twin fold" F*, goes from a state 1 ( P*1 ) to a state 2 ( P*2 ). We just keep one space
marker x = x1 ( doing x2 = 0 and x3 = 0 ). The amplitude of such an evolution is:

marker x = x1 ( doing x2 = 0 and x3 = 0 ). The amplitude of such an evolution is:

(where, conventionnaly, c = h = 1).  

This path owns a conjugated image in our space-time fold F. Due to the effect of PT symmetry, the "vision" of some hypothetic
observers, located in the folds F and F*, would be different. For the observer located in the fold F the particle, owing a mass m
and an impulsion  p  moves  from  the  state  2  to  the  state  1  (  P and T both add a minus sign  to  the  impulsion  ). This movement
occurs during a time-interval Δt' = t'1 - t'2 = t2 - t1, and from a position x2 to a position x1.
If, for an example, a neutrino νe , with a left helicity, moves in the fold F*, from the "point of view" of the fold F its helicity will
be reversed: it will be an antineutrino.
 

2- Shifting to complete extended Poincaré group

The  idea  of  Feynmann  ( PT-symmetrical  particles  )  implies  the  presence  of  antichron  components in the  group.  In  the group
presented in reference [1] and [2] space inversion is already present, due to their presence in the basic orthochron Lorentz group.
They are required to take account of disntinct helicities for photons and neutrinos.

We could extend the group, introducting a time-switch matrix:

Multiplying and the elements of the orthochron sub-group we could build the antichron components. But let us do it in a simpler
way:

This group contains all the required components: orthochron and antichron, but such writing evidences the PT-symmetry (μ = - 1)
in a convenient way. This is a eight components group ( 2 x 2 x 2 ). The group of [2] is a sub-group of (6) whence the group of
[2] was a sub-group of the one of [1]. The coadjoint action is found to be:

Here again, we identify the scalars χ i to the particle's charges set:

λ = - 1 achieves:

{χ i} = { q , cB , cL , cμ , cτ , ϖ }

ζ - Symmetry: {ζ i} ----> {- ζ i}

Here again ζ - Symmetry is assimilated to matter-antimatter duality. With this material we can analyze the impact of the different
components  on  the  momentum.  As we have  antichron  terms  our  momentum  space  must  be  extended  to  ( E < 0 ) momentums
sectors. See figure 1.

its momentum and movement spaces.

 
 

It  becomes  easy  to  examine  the  impact  of  each  component  on  momentum  and  movement.  We  shall consider a reference
movement and momentum J+
1 , refering to positive energy matter (the impact on positive energy photons will be analysed in a
second step).

The sector of the group in which the element is chose will be grey.
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

Next, the movements of ordinary matter.

λ = +1 μ = +1

λ μ = +1

The charges are unchanged. The movement M2 refers to ( E > 0 ), positive mass, orthochron matter.

Charges unchanged.

associated to the movement of normal matter: the new movement corresponds to Dirac's antimatter.  

 

 
 

On the figure 5 the line M1 figures the movement of normal, orthochron matter. We figures straight lines because ou group does
not take account of force field, like gravitational or electromagnétic field. It only runs the behaviour of lonely particles, charged
mass-points.
We choose an element in the grey area, corresponding to a ( λ = -1 ; μ = 1 ) matrix. The ( λ = - 1 ) value changes the signs of all
the ζ i. They become negative.
The  new  path  is  in  the  second sector, corresponding  to  antimatter.  As λ μ  =  -  1  the  charges are reversed.  But  as  time  is not
reversed, the energy and the mass of the particle remains positive. This is a geometric description of (orthochron) antimatter after
Dirac.
 
 
 
 
 

Two more sectors has to be explored. On the third we examine the impact of ( λ = - 1 ; μ = - 1 ) element on the momentum and
movement.

( λ  =  -  1 ) reverses the {ζ  i}.  According  to  our  geometric  definition  this new movement corresponds to  antimatter,  for it takes
place in the second sector of space { ζ 1 , ζ 2 , ζ 3 , ζ 4 , ζ 5 , ζ 6, x, y , z , t }.
( μ = - 1 ) gives a PT-symmetry, reverses the signs of ( x, y , z , t )
But  (  λ  μ  =  +  1  )  keeps  the  charges unchanged. This is "PT-symmetric antimatter",  so  that  it  is  a  geometric description of
antimatter after Feynmann.

But the group belongs to the antichron sector, so that (coadjoint action) the energy and the mass of the particle is reversed.

PT-symmetrical object does not identify completely with Dirac's antimatter, for it changes the sign of the mass. If such particles
exist, they can produce full annihilation with positive mass particles. 
 

 

Fig. 6: ( λ= -1 ; μ = -1 ) elements transform movement of normal matter into movement 

of antimatter (ζ-symmetry) of PT-symmetrical object, runing bacward in time.

Does not identify completely with Dirac's one: negative mass and negative energy.

 

 
The last elements correspond to the sector ( λ= 1 ; μ = -1 )
( λ = 1 ) --- > the movement is still in the matter's sector: no ζ-symmetry.
( μ = -1 ) goes with a PT-symmetry. The particule runs backward in time.
( λ = -1 ): C-symmetry. The charges are reversed.

This  is  CPT-symmetrical matter,  so  that  it  corresponds  to  a  geometrical  interpretation  of the so-called "CPT  theorem", which
asserts that the CPT-symmetric of a particle should be identical to that particle. That's not true. This movement corresponds to an
antichron movement. The particle goes backward in time, si that (caodjoint action) its mass and energy become negative .

If CPT-symmetrical particle do exist and if they collide normal particle, complete annihilation occurs. 
 

 

Fig.7: ( λ = 1 ; μ = - 1 ) case. Corresponds to CPT-symmetry. 

But the coadjoint action gives negative mass and energy.

The CPT-symmetric of a particle of matter is a particule of matter, but with negative mass.

 
 

 
 
Now, examine the impact on photons movement and moment. The ζ-symmetry has no impact on it: there is no "antiphoton". As
all the charges of the photon are zero a does not change it. It is identical to its antiparticle.

The coadjoint action of orthochron  components  modifies  the  movement  and  the moment of the photon, but  keep  unchanged its
energy. See figure 8.

Conclusion

We  have  extend  the  group,  including  antichron  elements.  We  refind the geometric description  of  Dirac's  antimatter.  But the
analysis of the coadjoint action of antichron elements of the group produces PT-symmetrical and CPT-symmetrical movements.  

We  find  that  PT-symmetry  goes  with matter ----->  antimatter  transform.  It  joins  Feynmann's  idea.  The  PT-symmetric of a
particle of matter is a particle of antimatter. But the coadjoint action of antochron elements reverses the mass and the energy. Then
we cannot identify the PT-symmetrical of a particle of matter to its antiparticle, after Dirac's description.The first owns a negative
mass and a negative energy.

Similarly the CPT-symmetric of a particle of  matter  is  a  partocle  of  matter,  but  with  a negative mass, for it goes backwards in
time.  

The problem remains unsolved. As recommanded by J.M.Souriau, we could limit the dynamic group to its orthochron part, but
we would'nt have PT and CPT-symmetrical object for symmetries including time-symmetry becomes forbiden.  

If we keep the antichron sector we have an universe filled by positive and negative mass particles.

Charybde or Scylla?

In the next paper we shall propose another solution.
