The	«	Janus	Cosmoloogical	Model	»	is	physically	(and	mathematically	)	unconsistent	

Before	all	let	us	give	our	conclusion	:		
The	Janus	equations	are	the	following	:

The	classical	definition	of	
(+) which	ensures	its	tensorial	conservation	with	respect	to	
(+)is	:

Smatter(+)	refers	to	the	action	of	the	ordinary	matter.	There	is	no	need	to	give	the	
definition	of		
,	which	was	not	precised	in	the	works	of	Petit	and	d’Agostini.		
The	«	Janus	Model	»	does	not	fit	the	Bianchi	identities.	In	effect	the	system	(1a)	+	(1b)	
goes	with	:

The	the	Janus	system	becomes	:

with	(4c)	:		
The	authors	have	introduced	the	factor	
		is	order	to	cure	a	difficulty	to	some	
unconsistency	linked	to	a	simplified	model	but	as	will	be	shown	further	this	does	not	
prevent	the	severe	unconsistency	in	the	case	of	the	hydrostatic	equilibrium	when	we	
consider	the	cas	of	a	self-gravitating	star,	in	the	Newtonian	limit	 c → ∞	
The	central	point	is	based	on	the	constainsts		
(5a)																																																																	
 ∇ νTµν = 0	
(5b)																																																																	
 ∇ νTµν = 0		
where	 ∇	is	the	connection	linked	to	
gµν.		
To	illustrate	such	point	let	us	consider	the	simple	case	where	the	«	positive	»	matter	
comes	both	from	a	background	source		
o	(	for	example	a	star,	or	the	sun	in	our	solar	
system	),	considered	as	a	sphere	filled	by	a	uniform	distribution	of	«	dust	»,	i.e	
1 = ρ1 uµuν,	then	:

o + ρ1 uµuν	
o + ρ1 uµuν

	Here	the	covariant	4-velocity	field

gµνuµuν = − 1	.		Considered	with	respect	to	the	second	metric	
gµν		the	co-vectorial	field	
defines	in	a	unique	way	the	equivalent	4-velocity	field	
gµν uµuν = − 1)	as	defined	above.		
Now	consider	the	two	conservation	laws	(5a)	and	(5b).		
Let	us	first	concentrate	on	the	movement	of	the	test	dust	matter.	The	laws	(5a)	and	(5b)	
the	following	constrainst	:		
 ∇µ uµ = 0	
(10)																																																																							
(11)																																																																							
 ∇µ (ρ1uµ) = 0	
 ∇µ uµ = 0	
(12)																																																																							
 ∇µ (ρ1uµ) = 0	
(12)																																																																							
	The	physical	meaning	of	the	equation	(10)	is	the	following.	It	shows	that	the	lines	of	the	
universe	of	the	matter	(defined	by	 uµ = gµνuν	)	are	geodesics	of	
(+)	,	while	the	
third	equation	(12)	says	that	the	same	positive	matter	is	also	ruled	(by	the	equations	
 "−"	)	to	obey	another	equations	of	the	movement		
 ∇µ uµ = 0	which	shows	that	the	line	
of	the	universe	defined	by	 uµ = gµν uν	must	be	geodesics	derived	from	the	
metric.	But	the	4-velocity	field	 uµ	is	not	independent	of		 uµ.	Considered	as	a	covariant	
field	it	is	basically	the	same	through	a	renormalization	factor	 uµ = uµ / N,	equation,	so	
that	
uµ = gµνuν / N = gµσ gσνuν / N.	As	the	two	metrics	
(+)	are	a	
(+)	and	
priori	different	I	don’t	see	how	it	could	be	possible	(	considering	a	complex	general	time	
gµν and gµν	)	to	have	the	same	
dependent	solution,	defined	by	arbitrary	Cauchy	data	for		
matter	following	different	motion	equations.	If	we	consider	for	example	some	initial	
velocity	data	for	a	a	test	dust,	such	velocity	would	be	supposed	to	folllow	at	the	same

time	two	distinct	rules	of	evolution,	which	is	mathematically	absurd	for	a	classical	
theory	!	
			Another	physico-mathematical	contradiction	may	arise	from	equations	(4a)	and	(4b)	
applying	such	system	to	the	structure	of	a	self-gravitating	star,	in	Newtonian	limit.	
Consider	a	background	source	corresponding	to	a	perfect	fluid	:		
(13)																																									
o(+) = ( ρc2 + p ) uµuν + pgµν		
I	will	limit	the	analysis	to	the	almost	Newtonian	conditions.	I	will	show	that	this	theory	
is	self	contradictory	and	does	not	lead	to	any	physical	solution.		
I	recall	that	the	linearized	solution	of	the	Einstein	equations	may	be	written	:		
c2 )δi j			
(14)																																			
where	U	is	the	newtonian	potential	from	Poisson	equation	:

Due	to	the	formal	symmetry	of	the	system	(4a)	+	(4b)	we	get	the	corresponding	
linearized	solution	:

It	is	now	very	important	to	take	in	charge	the	consequences	of	the	equations	(5a)	and
