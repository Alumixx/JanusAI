Anti-Gravitation

Abstract

The possibility of a symmetry between gravitating and anti-gravitating particles is exam-
ined. The properties of the anti-gravitating ﬁelds are deﬁned by their behavior under gen-
eral diffeomorphisms. The equations of motion and the conserved canonical currents are
derived, and it is shown that the kinetic energy remains positive whereas the new ﬁelds can
make a negative contribution to the source term of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. The interac-
tion between the two types of ﬁelds is naturally suppressed by the Planck scale.

1 Introduction

The role of symmetries in nature has marked the progress of physics during the last
centuries. The use of symmetries has proven to be a powerful tool like no other,
underlying General Relativity (GR), leading to the discovery of anti-particles and
the establishment of the quark model.

With these successes of symmetry principles in mind, it is a question lying at hand
whether there is a symmetry between positive and negative masses.

In this work, a framework is presented to include particles with negative gravita-
tional charge into classical gravity and ﬁeld theory. The anti-gravitating particles
are introduced as particles that transform in a modiﬁed way under general diffeo-
morphisms. In a (locally) ﬂat space, they transform like the standard particles. This
generalization of the equivalence principle leads to the introduction of a modiﬁed
covariant derivative. The generalized covariant derivative ensures the homogeneous

transformation behavior of the new ﬁeld’s derivatives. From this, the equation of
motion is derived for the new ﬁelds.

The introduction of anti-gravitation in this way solves three severe problems that
seem to come along with the notion of negative masses:

(1) In GR, the motion of a particle in a gravitational ﬁeld is independent of the
particle’s mass. This seems to indicate that no particle can be repelled by
a positvely gravitating source and leads to immediate contradictions. In the
here discussed setup, also the anti-gravitating particle’s equation of motion is
modiﬁed, which follows from its behavior under general diffeomorphisms. In
this case, like gravitational charges attract, and unlike charges repel.

(2) In the here used formalism, only the source to the gravitational ﬁeld can ex-
perience a change of sign. The kinetic energy term in the Lagrangian remains
positive and thus, the vacuum remains stable.

(3) The third problem is the lacking evidence. As we will show, the interaction
between gravitating and anti-gravitating matter is mediated by gravity only,
and therefore is suppressed by the large value of the Planck scale.

In addition to being a viable extension of GR, the here proposed existence of neg-
ative gravitational charges can open new points of view in Cosmology and Astro-
physics, especially with regard to singularity avoidence and Dark Energy. Though
it will become clear from the analysis that the newly introcued particles are only
very weakly interacting with standard matter, their presence might be relevant at
large (cosmological) distances, at high (Planckian) densities and in strongly curved
backgrounds.

The proposal of a gravitational charge symmetry has previously been examined in
Refs. (1; 2; 3; 4). Furthermore, there have been various approaches (5; 6; 7; 8; 9;
10; 11; 12; 13) to include anti-gravitating matter into quantum theory as well as
into GR. The topic of negative energies has recently received attention within the
context of ghost condensates (14; 15; 16; 17; 18).

This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, the deﬁnition for the anti-
gravitating particles is given, based on their transformation properties under the
gauge- and Lorentz-group. Section three examines the modiﬁed ﬁeld equations that
follow from the inclusion of these particles into GR, as well as conservation laws,
and the motion of test particles. General comments and discussion can be found in
section 4. We conclude in section 5.

Throughout this paper we use the convention c = ¯h = 1. The signature of the metric
is (−1, 1, 1, 1). Small Greek indices k ,n ,e ... are space-time indices.

2 Deﬁnition of Anti-Gravitating Matter

The unitary representations U of a gauge group G deﬁne the transformation be-
havior of particle ﬁelds Y
. For two elements of the group g, g′, the representation
fulﬁls

U (g)U (g′) = U (gg′)

,

and the ﬁeld transforms as Y → Y

′ = U (g)Y
construct a second representation, deﬁned by

. From this, it is always possible to

eU(g) = U ((gT )−1)

,

which belongs to the charge-conjugated particle. The anti-particle Y
according to the contragredient representation, U, which is U(g) = U (g−1).

transforms

In case of a local symmetry, these transformations lead to the introduction of gauge-
covariant derivatives in the usual way. Suitable combinations of particles with anti-
particles allow to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians.

From the above, it is clear why there is no charge-conjugation for gravity. If the
gauge-group is the Lorentz-group SO(3, 1), then the elements L
fulﬁll L −1 = L T ,

which means that in this case the second representation eU is equivalent to U.

However, this does not apply when the ﬁeld transforms under a general diffeomor-
phism G. Let Y
be a vector ﬁeld and an element of the tangent space T M. Under a
general diffeomorphism G, the ﬁelds and its conjugate behaves as

T M : Y → Y

′ = GY

,

T M∗ : Y → Y

′ = Y G−1

,

where T M∗ is the dual to T M.

The equivalence principle requires that the ﬁelds on our manifold locally transform
like in Special Relativity. I.e. if G is an element of the Lorentz-group the ﬁelds
have to transform like Lorentz-vectors. However, the generalization to a general
diffeomorphism is not unique. Instead of Eq. (3) one could have chosen the ﬁeld to
transform according to

T M : Y → Y

′ = (GT )−1Y

, T M∗ : Y → Y

′ = Y GT

.

Here, the space T M is a vector-space which spans the basis for these ﬁelds, and
T M∗ is its dual. In case G was an element of the Lorentz-group, i.e. G−1 = GT ,

both representations (3,4) agree. For general diffeomorphisms that will not be the
case. Indeed, one sees that the newly introduced ﬁelds will have a modiﬁed scaling
behavior.
For the following, it is convenient to introduce a map t which, in the vector-
representation, is a vector-space isomorphism from T M to T M. For the map t

It will be useful to clarify the emerging picture of space-time properties by having

The newly introduced ﬁeld Y

under local Lorentz-transformations like a Lorentz-vector in Special Relativity. But
it differs in its behavior under general diffeomorphisms.

n = gk

In order not to spoil the advantages of the Ricci-calculus, it will be useful to intro-
duce a basis for the new ﬁelds that transforms accordingly. Locally, the new ﬁeld
can be expanded in this basis ¶
k . These basis elements form again a bundle on the
manifold, that is denoted with T M. To each of the elements of T M also a dual space
exists, deﬁned as the space of all linear maps on T M. This space is denoted by T M∗
and its basis as dxk . The map from T M to T M∗ will be denoted gk
n , and deﬁnes a
scalar product on T M.

Note, that the underlined indices on these quantities do not refer to the coordinates
of the manifold but to the local basis in the tangential spaces. All of these ﬁelds still
are functions of the space-time coordinates xn .

For completeness, let us also deﬁne the combined maps:

T M −→ T M∗ :

n = t

As one sees from the transformation properties summarized in Eqs.(4), the map
n maps an element of T M to its transponed. This transposition does not involve
the metric tensor and is independent of the metric itself. In particular, one sees
| = 1, since transposition does not change the

determinant.

Basis transformations in both spaces belong together, since their elements share
the transformation properties Eqs.(4) with the same G. The map t
does not in-
troduce an additional coordinate transformation in the underlined space, it does not
change the volume element, introduce a shear, or an additional rotation on T M∗.
One should keep in mind that the introduction of the additional spaces is just a
helpful tool to deal with the different transformation properties of the new ﬁelds.

The relation between the introduced quantities is summarized in Figure 1 from
which we also read off the cycle leading back to identity on T M∗ and on T M∗,
respectively

The coordinate expansion of t seems to depend on the basis chosen in T M as well
as on those in T M. However, this ambiguity in the form of the map is only seem-
ingly. The basis ¶
n does not transform independently as stressed earlier. The
relation between both basis transformations is ﬁxed by the map t . To see this, note
that even though the map t
for certain choices of coordinates might be trivial, its
importance lies in its transformation behavior. Its covariant derivative takes into
account the change of transformation behavior from T M to T M.

The transformation behavior in Eq. (5) together with the observation that in a lo-
cally orthonormal basis both ﬁelds transform identical under local Lorentz-trans-
formations, gives us an explicit way to construct t . We choose a local orthonormal
basis ˆe in T M, which is related to the coordinate basis by the locally linear map
E ˆe = ¶ . In this basis, the metric is just h and ˆt
is just the identity. One then ﬁnds t
in a general coordinate system by applying Eq.(5)

t = (ET )−1ˆt E−1 = (EET )−1

.

Using Eq. (10), we again conﬁrm that the determinant is |t

| = 1 and therefore

1 = gg ,

|t

| = |g|

k | = |g|

.

The properties of the vector-ﬁelds are transferred directly to those of fermionic
ﬁelds by using the fermionic representation and transformations of t . In this case,
the map ( )†g 0, instead of the metric, is used to relate a particle to the particle
transforming under the contragredient representation.

It is now straightforward to introduce a covariant derivative for the new ﬁelds,
in much the same way as one usually introduces the derivative for the charge-
conjugated particles. We will use the notation (cid:209)
for the general-covariant deriva-
tive and D for the general covariant derivative including the gauge-derivative of the
ﬁelds. It is understood that the form of the derivative is deﬁned by the ﬁeld it acts
on, even though this will not be noted explicitly.
Let us ﬁrst introduce the derivative in the direction of n on the basis in a general
way by

k = G

k = G

.

We will further also use the notation

So far, this is only a deﬁnition for the symbols G
. To get an explicit
formula for these Christoffelsymbols one commonly uses the requirement that the
covariant derivative on the metric itself vanishes. The geometrical meaning is that
the scalar product is covariantly conserved. To keep the symmetry between both

From this, one can explicitly compute the form of the derivatives in Eqs. (12).

At this point it is useful to state a general expectation about the connection coefﬁ-
cients. For a particle moving in a curved spacetime, it is possible to choose a freely
falling coordinate system, in which the Christoffelsymbols in Eq.(15) vanish. How-
ever, this freely falling frame for the particle will in general not also be a freely
falling frame for the anti-gravitational particle. Therefore, the Christoffelsymbols
in Eq.(17) will not vanish in the freely falling frame of the usually gravitating par-
ticle. Both sets of symbols therefore will not be proportional to each other.

One further derives the useful relations

a = ¶
a = ¶

a − G
a + G

With these covariant derivatives, one obtains the Lagrangian of the anti-gravitational
ﬁeld by replacing all quantities with the corresponding anti-gravitational quantities
and using the appropriate derivative for the new ﬁelds to assure homogenous trans-
formation behavior

energy terms are positive. A particle with negative gravitational mass behaves like
an ordinary particle except for its gravitational interaction, encoded in the covariant

As one sees by examining the Lagrangian, there is no direct interaction between
gravitating and anti-gravitating particles. Nevertheless, both of the particle-species
will interact with the gravitational ﬁeld, which mediates an interaction between
them. However, this coupling is suppressed with the Planck scale. Therefore, the
production of anti-gravitating matter is not observable today because all ingoing
particles, in whatever scattering process we look at, are the normally gravitating
ones that we deal with every day.

3 Properties of Anti-Gravitating Matter

From the results of the last section, we can now write down the most general form
of the Lagrangian which includes the anti-gravitating matter ﬁelds and is symmetric
under exchange of gravitational with anti-gravitational quantities. It takes the form

We recall that t
just transpones quantities and is independent of the metric tensor.
It does not rotate the basis relative to each other, nor does it change the volume
element or introduce a shear. Under a variation of the metric, this quantity remains
unaltered d
, because it transforms
non trivially under coordinate transformations which form a subset of the metric
variations. In particular with Eq. (8) one obtains

n = 0. This, however, is not the case for t

The interpretation of the so derived gravitational SETs is straightforward: Under a
perturbation of the metric, the anti-gravitational ﬁelds will undergo a transforma-
tion exactly opposite to these of the normal ﬁelds as one expects by construction.
The t -functions convert the indices and the transformation behavior from T M to
the usual tangential space.

Most importantly, we see that the SET of the anti-gravitating ﬁeld yields a con-
tribution to the source of the ﬁeld equations with a minus sign (and thus justiﬁes
the name anti-gravitation). This is due to the modiﬁed transformation behavior of
the ﬁeld components. However, we also see that the second term, arising from the

variation of the metric determinant, does not change sign. For one of the most im-
portant cases however, the fermionic matter ﬁeld, the second term vanishes since
the Lagrangian is zero when the ﬁeld fulﬁlls the equation of motion.

If one considers the Lagrangian of the Dirac-ﬁeld one has to formulate the action
in form of the tetrad ﬁelds. The above used argument then directly transfers to the
Dirac ﬁeld through the properties of the anti-gravitational ﬁeld under diffeomor-
phisms. For the fermions, the SET then can be simpliﬁed inserting that the ﬁeld
fulﬁlls the equations of motion D/ Y = D/ Y = 0.

The corresponding conservation law of the derived source terms as follows from
the Bianchi-identities is as usual (cid:209)

) = 0.

(Tk

By variation of the action Eq. (23) with respect to the ﬁelds, on obtains the equa-
tions of motion in form of the Euler-Lagrange equations. Using the the covariant
form of Gauss’ law one ﬁnds as usual

For this derivation one can still use the usual covariant form of Gauss’ law since
the derivatives (cid:209)

transform as usual vectors with respect to the index n

.

Now it is crucial to note that the kinetic SET as deﬁned from the Noether current
does not have a change in sign, as no variation of the metric is involved and the
gravitational properties of the ﬁelds do not play a role. To clearly distinguish this
canonical SET from the gravitational source term, let us denote the canonical SET
with Q

for the gravitational SET.

which is also covariantly conserved (cid:209)

k = 0.

Unfortunately, in general these quantities are neither symmetric, nor are they trace-
less or gauge-invariant. For GR, Belinfante’s tensor is the more adequate one (19).
Though the ’correct’ kinetic SET is a matter of ongoing discussion (19; 20; 21),
the details will not be important for the following. Instead, let us note that, from the
Noether current, we get a total conserved quantity for each space-time direction k
,
leading to the conservation equations

k + t

k = 0 .

The form of the second term of Eq. (35) is readily interpreted: when the anti-
gravitating particle gains kinetic energy on a world line, the gravitational particle
would loose energy when traveling on the same world line. The interaction with the
gravitational ﬁeld is inverted.

One thus can identify the anti-gravitating particle as a particle whose kinetic mo-
mentum vector transforms under general diffeomorphism according to Eq.(4), whereas
the standard particle’s kinetic momentum transforms according to Eq.(3).

It is also instructive to look at the motion of a classical test particle by considering
the analogue of parallel-transporting the tangent vector. The particle’s world line is
denoted xn (l ), and the anti-gravitating particle’s world line is denoted xn (l ) 1 .

In contrast to the gravitating particle, the anti-gravitating particle parallel trans-
ports not its tangent vector ta
, but instead the related quantity in T M,
which corresponds to the kinetic momentum, and is ta
. On the particle’s
world line xn (l ), it is ta which is covariantly conserved. Parallel transporting is
then expressed in evaluating the derivative in direction of the curve and set it to
zero. For the usual geodesic which parallel transports the tangential vector one has

1 A word of caution is necessary for this notation: the underlined xn does only indicate that
the curve belongs to the anti-gravitating particle; it is not related to the curve of the particle

and insert Eq.(19).

It will be instructive to also derive this anti-geodesic equation in a second way,
which makes use of the energy conservation rather than postulating parallel trans-
port. Let us look at an anti-gravitating test particle of nonzero but negative gravita-
tional mass m moving in a strong gravitational ﬁeld. The particle’s energy conser-
vation law Eq.(35) in the background ﬁeld reads:

+ G

+ G

= 0 .

The particle moves on the world line yn
(l ), where l = x0(l ) is the eigen
time. For the particle of nonzero mass it can be used to parameterize the curve. The
kinetic SET is then a function of y and can be written as (22)

(y) = mZ dxn

where the second and the last term in the brackets cancel. Demanding that this be
valid on the world line of the particle, one again ﬁnds Eq.(38).

On both our ways to derive this equation, we have not used one of the most common
approaches which introduces the particle’s world line as the extremal of a variation
of the length of the curve. Here we have instead solely used the consequences from
a variation of the action Eq. (23) which includes geodesic motion as well as anti-
geodesic motion.

It is important to note that the equations of motion Eq.(38) are invariant under
general diffeomorphism, provided that the quantities are transformed appropriately.
In case the space-time is globally ﬂat, one can choose g = h
,
and t = Id, and both sets of Christoffelsymbols vanish. Since in this case both
curves which describe the motion of the particles are identical, they will be identical
for all choices of coordinate systems in a globally ﬂat background.

. It is then also g = h

4 Discussion

In the presence of strong curvature effects, one expects the interaction between both
types of matter to become important. Since the anti-gravitating contribution to the
source-term of the ﬁeld equations is negative, the positive energy theorem can be
violated. The implications of this feature for the possibility of singularity avoidance
should be investigated further.

Furthermore, the existence of negative gravitational sources can allow gravity to be
neutralized, which could be used the address the stabilization and compactiﬁcation
problem within the context of extra dimensions.

It should also be noted that the anti-gravitating particles do not alter the Hawking-
radiation of black holes. The black hole horizon is a trapped surface only for usual
photons, not for the anti-graviating ones. Indeed, it would be very puzzeling if a
particle could be trapped by a source it is repelled by. Therefore, the anti-gravitating
particles will not contribute to the Hawking ﬂux.

5 Conclusions

We have introduced particles into the Standard Model that can cause negative grav-
itational sources. These particles are deﬁned by their transformation behavior under
general diffeomorphism. In ﬂat space they obey the laws of Special Relativity. We
thereby have relaxed the equivalence principle.

The number of particles in the Standard Model is doubled in this scenario: each
particle has an anti-gravitating partner particle which only differs in its opposite re-
action to the gravitational ﬁeld. It is not necessary to have a negative kinetic energy
term. We have shown that the interaction between gravitating and anti-gravitating
matter is mediated solely by gravitation. It is therefore naturally very weak, ex-
plaining why we have not seen any anti-gravitating matter so far.
