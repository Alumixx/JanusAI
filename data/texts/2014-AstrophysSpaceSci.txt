Abstract The observed acceleration of the universe arises
a puzzling question. What is the nature of a dark energy
that would cause this phenomenon? We recall the arguments
against the existence of negative matter on General Relativ-
ity grounds. They vanish if the universe is considered as a
manifold M4 associated to two coupled metrics, solutions of
a coupled ﬁeld equation system. We build a non-steady so-
lution where the positive species accelerates while the neg-
ative one decelerates. So that dark energy is replaced by
(dominant) negative matter action.

1 Introduction

As pointed out by Riess et al. (1998), Perlmutter et al.
(1999), reviewed by Riess (2000), Filippenko and Riess
(2001), Leibundgut (2001), observations of type Ia super-
novae at redshift z < 1 rise a serious problem, showing that
the universe accelerates, this phenomenon being attributed
to some puzzling “dark energy”. Expanding this investiga-
tion on SNe Ia comforts such conclusion (Knop et al. 2003).
This has been extended to larger redshifts samples (Tonry
et al. 2003; Barris et al. 2004). See also Riess (2004). No-
body anticipated such startling phenomenon. The magnitude
of the observed acceleration was not anticipated by theory
and continues to defy a post facto explanation. What this

newly discovered component of the universe could be made
of?

2 Can negative mass play a role in physics?

The observed acceleration of the universe suggests the effect
of a negative pressure, associated to a negative mass con-
tent. Is it possible that the Universe would contain negative
energy particles? The dynamic group theory (Souriau 1970)
shows that such concept comes from the antichron compo-
nents of the Poincaré group. This last contains four connex
components. The ﬁrst four form the orthochron subgroup, or
restricted Poincaré group. The last four form the antichron
subset, whose elements reverse time. The coadjoint action of
this group on its momentum shows that time inversion goes
with energy, and mass inversion. Quantum theory of ﬁelds
analyzes the inversion of space and time too. In dynamical
groups theory groups are built with real components. In QFT
the T operator become complex, so that it can be either lin-
ear and unitary, either antilinear and antiunitary. Weinberg
(2005, pp. 75–76) writes, we quote:

“At this point we have not decided whether P and T
are linear and unitary or antilinear and antiunitary. The de-
cision is an easy one. Setting ρ = 0 in Eq. (2.6.4) gives
−1 = −iH , where H ≡ P° is the energy operator. If P
PiH P
were antiunitary and antilinear then it would anticommute
−1 = −H . But for any state Ψ of energy
with i, so PH P
−1Ψ of energy −E.
E > 0, there would be another state P
There are no states of negative energy (energy less than that
of the vacuum), so we are forced to choose the other al-
ternative: P is linear and unitary and commutes than an-
ticommutes with H . On the other hand, setting ρ = 0 in
−1 = −iH . If we supposed that T
Eq. (2.6.6) yields TiH T
is linear and unitary we could simply cancel the is, and ﬁnd

−1 = −H , with the again disastrous conclusion that for
TH T
−1Ψ of en-
any state Ψ of energy E there is another state T
ergy −E. To avoid this, we are forced to conclude that T is
antilinear and antiunitary”. We see than the quantum theory
of ﬁelds is built from a priori choices about fundamental
operators, which are done in order to avoid the disastrous
fact to include negative energy particles in the theory”.

This absence is nothing but a pure hypothesis. A stronger
critic comes from General Relativity theory and was pointed
out in Bondi (1957). Newton’s law emerges naturally from
Einstein’s equation,
through Newtonian approximation.
Considering the action of a particle (2) on a particle (1),
Bondi deﬁnes three kinds of masses:

m(1)

i

d2r1
dt 2

= G(r2 − r1)m(1)
|r2 − r1|

p m(2)

a

mi is the inertial mass, mp the passive gravitational mass
and ma the active gravitational mass. Immediately the equiv-
alence principle gives mi = mp so that (1) becomes:

d2r1
dt 2

= G(r2 − r1)m(2)

a

|r2 − r1|

(1)

(2)

which shows that positive mass attracts both positive and
negative matter. Negative mass repels the two. So that two
negative masses repel each other and cannot form clumps
by gravitational instability. On another hand, if two masses
with same absolute values and opposite signs encounter, the
positive one escapes, while the negative one runs after it.
The two experience a constant acceleration, but energy and
momentum are conserved, because of the two masses are
negative. Such preposterous features banned negative mass
from cosmology during more than half a century.

3 Regions that behave as if they were ﬁlled by negative

matter

Several authors suggested that the voids are a fundamental
element of the large scale structure (LSS), with bubble-like
structure (De Lapparent et al. 1986; Kirshner et al. 1987;
Rood 1988; Geller and Huchra 1989; Petit 1994, 1995; Piran
1997; El-Ad et al. 1996, 1997). El-Ad and Piran (1997) sug-
gested that initial tiny perturbations, in the primordial den-
sity ﬁeld, “acting as if the had a negative mass”, could extend
and play a role in the LSS. He made the hypothesis, without
justiﬁcation, that negative mass could own a negative active
mass (from Bondi’s deﬁnition), but positive inertial and pas-
sive masses, so that two negative masses would mutually
attract. Negative material could form clusters. Positive and
negative masses would repel each other, which was studied
in references of Petit (1994, 1995). Piran developed a Void
Finder Algorithm which identiﬁes voids in reshift surveys

and measure their size and underdensity. In a more recent
paper Izumi et al. (2013) consider gravitational lensing shear
by the magnifying lens models such as negative mass com-
pact objects causing gravitational repulsion on light, like a
concave lens. They suggest, as on reference of Knop et al.
(2003) that negative masses might attract each other, and
form negative massive clumps, so that they could reside in
cosmological voids (and there, they mention Piran’s work ).
The demagnifying effect was previously predicted in Knop
et al. (2003), due to negative lensing effect. In addition they
have shown that the images by the lens models are radially
distorsed, due to the repulsive effect (instead tangentially,
when due to positive masses).

Classically, the observed distorsion of the images of
galaxies (weak lensing effect) is used to determine the three-
dimensional distribution of some hypothetical CDM. Con-
versely, when decoding the data, if one assumes that the ob-
served distorsion is radial, instead tangential, it could pro-
vide three-dimensional negative matter distribution. If this
last is found as a regular set of clumps, located at the cen-
ter of the observed big voids that would be in favor of the
presence of such negative mass clumps in our universe.

4 Towards a bimetric description of the universe

General relativity is based on a M4 manifold, associated to
a single Riemannian metric, considered as solution of Ein-
stein’s ﬁeld equation. On such grounds, negative matter can-
not cohabit with positive matter. What about a different ge-
ometrical framewok? A ﬁrst bimetric description was pro-
posed in Petit (1994, 1995) and Petit et al. (2001), then in
Henry-Couannier (2005) and Hossenfelder (2008). Let us
consider the following coupled ﬁeld equations system:
R(+)
R(−)

μν metric refers to positive energy (and mass if the have
one) particles. g(−)

sometimes use the notation: f ∈ {+,−}. In mixed form, we
will write the tensors:

ϕ and φ are functions that will be deﬁned further (to en-
sure energy conservation). Each metric produces its own
geodesics family. The two are distinct, so that opposite en-
ergy particles cannot encounter, on pure geometric grounds.
They interact only through gravitation. We assume that pos-
itive light, composed by positive energy photons, cruises
along null geodesics of metric g(+)
μν , while negative light,
composed by negative energy photons, cruises along null
geodesics of metric g(+)
μν . We assume that structures made
of positive masses can emit and capture positive energy pho-
tons. Similarly, structures made of negative masses can emit
and capture negative energy photons. So that on geomet-
ric grounds, negative structures would be invisible to us,
through our eyes or astronomic instruments.

We assume this bimetric universe is homogeneous and
isotropic, so that the Riemannian metrics become:

6 The nature of “dark energy”

(cid:5)(cid:5)(+) > 0 and a

(cid:5)(cid:5)(−) < 0. If we sup-
Assume E < 0. Then a
pose that our visible part of the universe corresponds to pos-
itive mass, then it accelerates, while the negative species
decelerates. Equation (13b) identiﬁes to Friedman equation,
while (13a) identiﬁes to Bonnor’s (1989) solution:
a(+)(u) = α2ch2u
t (+)(u) = α2

From dynamic group theory (Souriau 1970) all particles, in-
cluding photons, may have negative mass. If Lo is the ele-
ment of the orthochron restricted Lorentz group, let us con-
sider the following extension of the Poincaré group.

which acts on a ﬁve-dimensional Kaluza space. The dimen-
sion of the group is 11. Then the momentum gets an extra
scalar q, identiﬁed by J.M. Souriau as the electric charge

(Souriau 1964). The coadjoint action of the group gets an
additional relation:
(cid:5) = λμq

(16)

Matter-antimatter duality holds in the negative mass world.
The negative matter, which acts as “dark energy” is com-
posed by negative energy (and negative mass,
if they
have one) particles: electrons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos,
quarks, an so on, plus their antiparticles, plus photons.

7 Newtonian approximation

To develop approximation we need to expand the met-
rics into series around Lorentzian metrics. The Universe
is not homogeneous. When we develop classical Newto-
nian approximation we assume that the zeroth order term
is Lorentzian, which means that this metric is solution of
the ﬁeld equation with a null second member, describing
an empty portion of space. It is not necessary that this ze-
roth order solution corresponds to a description of the whole
universe, only a restricted portion of space, small enough
to encompass the interaction of particles, planets or stars,
considered as mass-points. Similarly, whatever is the time-
dependent model, it is possible to consider that the system
is quasi steady. In our bimetric description, we consider a
ﬁnite portion of quasi-steady empty space-time (null curva-
ture, Lorentzian metrics).
g(+) = η(+) + εη(+),
(17)
The two scale factor a(+) and a(−) are considered as con-
stants. Then, ﬁeld equations are expanded into a series. Ne-
glecting the second order terms, we ﬁnd:

which are Poisson-like equations, associated to our bimet-
ric model. Building the dynamics from this set of equa-
tions would perhaps require a more reﬁned solution, involv-
ing different speeds of light c(+)and c(−), and possibly time
scale factors T (+) and T (−). Anyway, it is possible to derive
those laws in the simpliﬁed case a(+) = a(−). Then:

The subsequent interaction laws differ from GR’s: posi-
tive masses attract together through Newton’s law. Negative
masses attract together though Newton’s law. Opposite signs
masses repel each other through an anti-Newton’s law.

Referring to the previous works of Bondi (1957) and
Bonnor (1989) the puzzling problem of runaway phe-
nomenon is eliminated. By the way this model ﬁts classical
veriﬁcation associated to GR. In effect, as the two species
repel each other, where positive mass is present, negative
mass is almost absent and the coupled ﬁeld equations sys-
tem reduces to:

On another hand, considering portions of space containing
a sphere ﬁlled by constant density matter (positive or neg-
ative), surrounded by void makes “internal” and “external”
Schwarzschild solutions features clearer, as ﬁrstly presented
in Petit (1995), introducing negative gravitational lensing ef-
fect, evoked in Izumi et al. (2013).
