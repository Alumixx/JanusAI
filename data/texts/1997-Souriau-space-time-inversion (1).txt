Thus we see that the total mass of the system is greater than the sum of 
the constituent masses, and in fact  depends on the motion of the system.

Inversions  of space and  time 

Let  U  be the space of motions of an isolated  relativistic dynamical sys-
tem.  Up  until now  we  have assumed that  the  restricted  Poincare group 
acts on U  while preserving the Lagrange form  (13.70). 

We  also  know  that  the Juli  Poincare group  has  4  connected  compo-
nents  (13.53).  It is  generated by the restricted Poincare group G and by 
the following  two operations,  namely,  space  inversion t

and  time  reversal 

(14.64) 

One  might  ask  whether  the Juli  Poincare  group  too  is  a  dynamical 
group  of  U.  It should  be  noted  that  general  relativity  argues  in  favor 
of  this.  Thus  let  us  consider  a  symplectic  manifold  U  (not  necessar-
ily  connected)  which  admits the full  Poincare  group  G'  as  a  dynamical 
group. 

It is  clear  that  the  restricted  Poincare  group  G  is  also  dynamical 
group  of  U  and  even  that  it  is  a  dynamical  group  of  each  connected 
component  of  U  (theorem  (1.51)).  We  know  that  the  action  of  G  has 
a  moment  defined  up  to  an  additive constant  on  each  component  of U, 
and that this  constant can be chosen  such that

where 'ljJ  is  the map that  assigns  to each  point x of U its  moment fl.  It 
is  clear  that  fl  is  also  a  moment of the  group  G'  because  the definition 
of moment (11.7)  only involves the Lie  algebra of the group. 

TECHNICAL  DISCUSSION:  Let I  be an arbitrary element of G'  and define 

F(x) ==  'ljJ(lv(x)) - Lg.('ljJ(x)). 

The  proof of  (11.7)  shows  that  F(x)  is  constant  on  each  component  of 
U. 

Now  let a  be an arbitrary element of G.  Then formula (14.65)  shows 

that 

gg.(F(x)) = 
or,  writing b = I-I  x  a  x  I, 

- a  x  Ig.('ljJ(x)) , 

Qg.(F(x)) = 

- I  x  bg.('ljJ(x)). 

Theorem (6.35)  shows  that  bEG.  Applying (14.'65)  again we  obtain 

Qg.(F(x)) = F(!!u(x)). 

Theorem  (1.51)  shows  that Qu (x)  belongs  to  the same component  of U 
as  x.  Thus F(!!u(x)) =  F(x), whence 

Qg.(F(x)) =  F(x) 

VaEG,VxEU. 

This  expresses  the fact  that  the  coboundary  of  the  torsor  F( x)  of  the 
group  Gis  zero  (see  definition  (11.19)).  From  this  it  is  elementary  to 
deduce  (using,  for  example,  expression  (13.107)  of the  coadjoint  repre-
sentation)  that F(x) is  zero.

We  thus have proved the identity 

(14.66) 

'ljJ(lv(x))  =  Lg.('ljJ(x)) 

v x  EU,  V I  E  G' , 

which extends the validity of (14.65)  to the full  Poincare group. 

This formula  applies  when  I  = I a  (space  inversion)  or  when  I  = I t 

(time reversal).  Calculating I sg•  and !J.g•  gives  (notation  (13.59)):

Let  us  now  extend definition  (14.1)  of an elementary system by pos-
tulating that itis the full  Poincare group G' which acts transitively and 
canonicallyon U.

From (14.66) it follows immediately that the moment ft  ==  'IjJ(x)  varies 
over  a  coadjoint  orbit  of  G'  when  x  varies  over  U.  If this  orbit  is  not 
connected, then  neither is  U since 'IjJ  is  continuous  (theorem (6.51)). 

On  the other hand,  we  know  that  every  orbit  in  U  of the  restricted 
Poincare group  Gis contained in a  connected component UD  of U.  Since 
G and G' have the same Lie algebra, these orbits have the same dimension 
as  U  (theorem  (6.20)).  They thus  are pairwise disjoint open  sets filling 
out UD.  But this is impossible if there is  more than one orbit because UD 
is  connected.  Hence each  connected  component  of U  is  an  orbit of the 
restricted Poincare group  and  thus  defines  an  elementary system  in  the 
restricted sense  (14.1). 

(14.70) 

It follows  that the space of motions of an elementary system for  the 
full  Poincare  group  is  obtained  by  taking  the  sum 263  of  the  spaces  of 
motions of several elementary systems in the restricted sense  (14.1).  D 

Let  us  treat some examples.

(14.67)  shows  that  time  revers al  I t  changes  the  sign  of the  energy  and 
thus  the  sign  of  the  mass  (14.4<»).  Consequently  it  tmnsforms  every 
motion  of a particle  of mass m  into  a  motion  of a particle  of mass  -mo 
On the other hand,  space inversion I s  preserves  the mass m  and the 

spin s.  Hence the associated  orbit of G'  has  two  components. 

(14.72) 

If 'IjJ  is  bijective, then  U  has  two  components as  weIl.  But it  is  pos-
sible  that  U  has  four  components.  A  model  of this  possibility  can  be 
constructed as  folIows: 

U  =  the set  of pairs x ==  (ft, c) 

[ft  lies in a  coadjoint 
orbit  and c = ±1]

There is  a  way  to  safeguard  the  connectedness  of U  and  thus  to  avoid 
particles  of negative mass.  First  one  postulates  that  1j;  is  injective and 
then  one  lets  the  full  Poincare  group  G'  act  on  the  unique  component 
where m  > 0  by  defining 

(14.74) 

(14.75) 

where Xt( a)  is  the  temporal character of a. 265 

However,  we  know  that  these  transformations  cannot  be  canonical 
(14.71).  More precisely, if Xt(a) = -1 (one says that  ais antichronous), 
the  transformation  g  defined  by  (14.74)  is  anticanonical  (definition 
(10.18) ). 

We  thus  have  to  modify  the  axioms  of symplectic mechanics  by  al-

lowing anticanonical transformations to belong to a  dynamical group. 

(14.76)  There is  another way  to arrive at  the same result.  It consists  of  exclud-
ing  the  antichronous  transformations  by  looking  only  at  the  subgroup 
G" defined  by Xt(a)  =  +1.  G", which is  called the  orthochronous group, 
is  indeed  a  dynamical group  (without  anticanonical elements) of a  con-
nected manifold. 

It should  be  obvious  that  these  various  conventions  have  to  be  judged 
0 
according to their ability to explain experiments. 266 

A  massless particle

in  the sense  of  (14.29).  These  particles  have  the  same  spin  s,  but  the 
formulce  (14.67)  show  that space inversion changes the helicity  and time 
revers al  the  sign  of the  energy.  It follows  that  the  coadjoint  orbit  has 
four  components  and  consequently  U  as  well.  Hence  1j;  is  necessarily  a 
bijection. 

264By  definition  Xs(a)  equals  +1  on  the  components  of the  group  G'  containing  1 
and  It  and  equals  -Ion the  components  containing  Is  and  It  .  Is.  It is  caUed  a

265xt (a)  equals  1  on  the  components  of G'  containing  1  and  I s  and  equals  -1 on 
the  components containing  It  and  It · Is.  It also satisfies  Xt(ab)  ==  Xt(a)Xt(b).

Experiments show that the known  massZess  particles (that is,  photons 
and  neutrinos)  appear  with  two  helicities  (that  is,  are  polarized  to  the 
Zeft  or  to  the  right  (see(15.105)).  This  is  an  inductive  argumentt  to 
include space  inversion in  the invariance group  of mechanics;  otherwise 
the  existence  of  two  massless  particles,  differing  only  by  their  helicity, 
would  be  a  mere coincidence. 

(14.79)  We  thus  have  to  give  up  in  general  the  idea  of  describing  a  mass-
less  particle  by  a  connected  manifold.  However,  one  can  eliminate the 
components with negative energy  by using one of the above  procedures: 
the introduction of anticanonical transformations by equation (14.74),  or 
the exclusion of antichronous transformations by (14.76).  Still more rad-
ically,  one  can  restrict  oneself to  the connected  group  G  (the restricted 
Poincare group)  and return to the previous  description (14.29).
