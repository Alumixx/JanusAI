Abstract	:		
If	one	tries	to	include	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	model	one	immediately	
comes	up	against	the	runaway	effect,	violating	the	action-reaction	principle.	It	is	then	
necessary	to	opt	for	a	model	with	two	metrics.	We	take	as	a	starting	point	Sabine	
Hossenfelder's	model,	which	is	mathematically	correct	but	incompatible	with	a	
confrontation	with	observational	data.	This	approach	is	taken	up	again	by	modifying	the	
field	equations	whose	solutions	then	make	it	possible	to	account	for	the	acceleration	of	
cosmic	expansion,	the	strong	gravitational	lens	effects	in	the	vicinity	of	galaxies	and	
clusters,	and	the	flatness	of	the	rotation	curves.	Using	the	theory	of	dynamic	groups	we	
show	that	this	negative	mass	is	a	copy	of	antimatter,	with	negative	mass	and	energy.	
This	approach	concretizes	the	idea	of	Andrei	Sakharov	and	solves	the	problem	of	non-
observation	of	primordial	antimatter.	The	remaining	questions	to	be	solved	to	make	this	
model	an	alternative	to	the	current	standard	model	ΛCDM	are	listed	below.

	1	–	What	future	for	cosmology?	
For	lack	of	promising	new	options,	cosmology	has	for	years	been	largely	oriented	
towards	what	could	be	called	chimerical	worlds.	Nowadays,	authors	submit	papers	with	
magic	words	such	as	"cosmic	strings,	monopoles,	branes,	firewall,	quintessence,	
Chaplying	gas,	axions",	which	do	not	constitute	a	true	model,	nor	offer	any	observational	
confirmation,	are	much	more	likely	to	be	published	than	those	that	attempt	to	use	
classical	mathematical	and	geometric	tools	that	some	will	consider	obsolete	or	outdated.	
Nevertheless,	it	has	proved	impossible	to	date	to	confer	an	identity	to	the	two	
components	that	serve	as	a	basis	for	the	mainstream	model	ΛCDM,	dark	matter	and	
black	energy.	What	will	happen	if,	in	the	coming	years,	we	fail	to	capture	dark	matter	
particles	in	underground	shelters,	or	in	space?	What	are	the	alternatives	to	this	model?	
The	Israeli	Mordechai	Milgrom	[1]	has	suggested	considering	modified	gravity.	But

there	is	currently	nothing	to	integrate	such	a	concept	into	Generalized	Relativity.Let	us	
add	that	this	idea	suffers	from	observational	contradictions.		A	second	alternative	is	to	
consider	the	existence	of	a	matter	of	negative	mass	which,	emitting	negative	energy	
photons,	would	thus	definitively	escape	optical	observations	and	would	only	reveal	its	
presence	through	its	gravitational	effects	
	2	–	Two	attempts	to	introduce	negative	masses	into	the	cosmological	model	
These	are	references	[2]	and	[3].	In	the	first	work	the	authors	try	to	bring	up	to	date	
Dirac	Milne's	cosmological	model	with	equal	amounts	of	positive	and	negative	mass.	It	is	
then	a	cosmos	free	of	gravitational	field	which	follows	a	law	of	linear	expansion	versus	
time.	It	is	further	suggested	that	this	second	matter	may	correspond	to	primordial	
antimatter,	pushing	away	our	own	matter.	An	advantage	put	forward	is	that	the	
cosmological	horizon	ct	then	grows	in	the	same	way	as	the	universe	itself.	Under	these	
conditions	its	homogeneity	would	be	assured	whatever	the	epoch	and	we	would	no	
longer	need	to	resort	to	the	theory	of	inflation.	The	authors	argue,	on	the	basis	of	
abundance	of	light	elements	calculations,	that	the	predictions	from	such	a	model	would	
be	compatible	with	observational	data.	But	this	model	then	finds	itself	in	complete	
contradiction	with	the	ΛCDM	model	and	with	the	observations	reporting	the	
phenomenon	of	acceleration	of	expansion	([4],	[5],	[6]).		Finally,	attention	is	drawn	to	
the	behavior	of	antimatter	created	in	the	laboratory	when	it	is	subjected	to	the	
gravitational	field	of	Earth,	without	explaining	why	this	antimatter	would	fall	upwards.	
In	the	second	essay	[3]	the	author	tries	to	melt	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	into	a	single	
entity	of	negative	mass.	To	make	it	play	the	role	attributed	to	the	cosmological	constant	
in	the	mainstream	model	ΛCDM	it	is	then	necessary	that	negative	mass	is	continuously	
created,	to	maintain	its	constant	density	by	a	phenomenon	that	is	not	described	in	the	
paper..		
(1)																																																									
Thus,	by	pretending	to	simplify	the	problem,	we	are	only	complicating	it.	However,	this	
study	contains	an	interesting	result	based	on	the	idea	that	galaxies	are	confined	in	gaps	of	
negative	mass.	The	author	shows	that	this	confinement	gives	flat	rotation	curves	at	the

		But	in	these	two	trials	the	runaway	phenomenon	remains	
	3	–	The	runaway	phenomenon.		
If	we	consider	keeping	the	current	geometric	paradigm,	we	come	up	against	the	
runaway	phenomenon.	Indeed	Einstein's	equation	provides	the	same	set	of	geodesics,	
referring	to	test	particles,	whether	they	have	a	positive	or	negative	mass,	whatever	the	
source	of	the	field.	
(2)																																																															
This	can	be	illustrated	by	examining	Schwarzschild's	solutions	where	the	mass	M,	
source	of	the	field,	can	be	positive	or	negative.

	With	M<0	we	get:	

Fig.3	:	Geodesic	paths	in	in	viciniy	ot	a	negative	mass.	

	This	can	be	translated	by	saying	that	the	positive	masses	attract	everything	and	the	
negative	masses	repel	everything.	Thus,	if	we	present	two	masses	of	opposite	signs,	the	
positive	mass	flees,	pursued	by	the	negative	mass,	which	represents	a	violation	of	the	
principle	of	action-reaction	:

Fig.4	:	Runaway	effect.	
This	phenomenon	had	been	highlighted	by	H.	Bondi	[7]	then	by	W.	Bonnor	[8].	In	the	
above-mentioned	essays	it	is	suggested	that	this	phenomenon	could	be	at	the	origin	of	
cosmic	rays.	If	we	want	to	avoid	this	phenomenon	and	restore	the	principles	of	
equivalence	and	reaction	action,	we	are	obliged	to	consider	that	masses	of	opposite	
signs	behave	differently	in	the	same	field	of	gravity.	It	is	therefore	necessary	to	consider	
two	geodesic	sets,	coming	from	two	different	metrics

In	2002	T.Damour	and	I.Kogan	[9]	introduce	the	formalim	of	fully	non-linear	bigravity.		
They	consider	two	branes,	«	right	»	and	«	left	»,	interacting	through	massive	gravitons.	They	
introduce	Lagrangian	densities	in	the	action	:	the	Ricci	terms	 RRLR − g R	,	 RL − g L,	the	
terms	corresponding	to	positive	matter	 LR − g Rand	negative	matter	  L(−) − g(−),	are	based	
	and			
four-dimensional	 hypervolumes	
corresponding

the	sources	of	the	two	materials	"right"	and	"left"	as	well	as	the	terms	and	reflecting	the	
interaction	between	the	two.	The	authors	then	consider	different	models:	branes,	Kaluza-
Klein	models,	non-commutative	geometry.	This	first	article	is	quickly	followed	by	a	second	
[10].	The	scientific	community	considers	at	the	time	that	this	essay	should	represent	an	
important	contribution	since	the	journal	Physical	Review	D	devotes	42	and	56	pages	to	
these	two	articles,	while	no	data	emerged	that	can	be	compared	with	any	observational	data.			
	5	–	A	bimetric	theory	with	exchange	symmetry.		
In	2008	[11]	Sabine	Hossenfelder	published	in	the	journal	Physical	Review	D	a	theoretical	
essay	entitled	"a	bimetric	theory	with	exchange	symmetry".	Both	metrics	have	Lorentzian	
signatures.	The	metric	 g	is	that	of	ordinary	matter.	The	behavior	of	the	second	matter	is	
deduced	from	a	metric	 h.	Using	what	the	author	calls	"pull	over",	a	Lagrangian	is	proposed:

		This	is	the	covariant	version	of	the	coupling	relationship	we	used	in	our	paper	[12].	A	
system	of	coupled	field	equations	corresponding	to	equations	(34)	and	(35)	of	section	IV	of	
paper	[11]	is	then	obtained	:	
	
(6)																																											
	  
 V	is	the	determinant	of		 
Pg.	The	author	then	studies	the	
solutions	of	the	system	without	a	second	member,	which	allows	him,	using	coupled	
Schwarzschild	solutions,	to	define	the	interaction	laws,	i.e.	the	inertial	masses	of	the	two	
species.	Masses	of	the	same	signs	attract	each	other	according	to	Newton's	law,	while	
masses	of	opposite	signs	repel	each	other.	The	principle	of	action-reaction	is	thus	saved.	The	
system	also	shows	a	negative	gravitational	lens	effect	that	the	masses	of	one	population	
create	on	the	photons	of	the	second	population	(these	being	the	particles	according	to	the	
null	geodesics	of	of	the	metric	of	the	second	population).	But	in	the	following	the	author	
tries	to	make	the	evolution	in	time	of	the	second	population	follow	the	evolution	of	the	
positive	masses	by	assuming	that	the	density,	which	involves	the	gravitational	mass,	of	the	
second	population	is	positive:	 ρ> 0.	This	is	then	obtained	by	arbitrary	choices	of	the	signs	
of	the	terms	present	in	the	Lagrangian.	A	violation	of	the	principle	of	equivalence	can	be	
deduced	from	this,	pointed	out	by	the	author.		The	aim	is,	while	maintaining	a	global	
symmetry	between	the	two	systems,	to	show	fluctuations,	very	non-linear,	whose	presence	
could	then	be	equivalent	to	the	addition	of	a	cosmological	constant	Λ.	But	the	mechanism	
giving	rise	to	these	fluctuations	is	not	described.	It	is	not	clear	how	such	fluctuations,	
  ( ρ! ρ > 0 )	,	could	lead	
occurring	in	a	system	where	the	densities	and	densities	are	equal	
to	effects	of	two	orders	of	magnitude	higher.	By	attempting	an	analogy,	it	would	be	like	
hoping	for	50-meter	high	waves	in	a	basin	with	50	cm	of	water.

	Nevertheless	
interesting	 and	
mathematically	correct.	It	is	the	physical	interpretation,	which	translates	into	the	choice	
of	signs	in	the	Lagrangian,	which	is	flawed.	We	modify	these	signs	of	matter	to	obtain	a	
negative	density	 ρ< 0and	pressure  p < 0.	Two	speeds	of	light	 c and c,	a	priori	unequal,	
appear,	as	well	as	curvature	indices	 k and k.	We	introduce	two	"Einstein	constants"	
 χand χ,	which	are	also	unequal	a	priori.	Using	the	same	mathematical	technique,	we	
then	obtain	the	system

	The	satisfaction	of	Bianchi's	identities	is	ensured,	by	construction,	by	the	application	a	
(reference	,	equation	[13]	):	
	(9)																																													
	(10)																																											
	About	the	equations	without	a	second	member,	nothing	is	changed.	But	the	mass	
creating	these	trajectories,	as	well	as	the	pressure	inside	it	and	its	density	are	perceived	
as	negative	  ( M < 0 , p < 0 , ρ< 0 )by	an	observer	made	of	positive	mass.	To	build	the	
evolution	of	the	two	systems	in	time,	two	FLRW	solutions	(metrics	that	Friedmann-
Lemaître-Robertson-Walker)	are	introduced.	In	these,	speeds	 c	and	 c	for	photons	
travelling	along	geodesics	of	zero	length	from	the	metrics	g	and	h	are	introduced.

	So	we	have	a	unique	M4	manifold	equipped	with	two	metrics	g	and	h	.	The	evolutions	of	the

	(39)																																																								
	The	exact	solution	of	this	equation	was	given	by	W.	Bonnor	[8].	Only	the	portion	of	this	
curve	corresponding	to	the	matter	phase,	should	be	considered.	Indeed,	when	the	curve	
is	extended	towards	the	origin	of	time,	a	non-zero	value	of	the	scale	factor	a	is	obtained.	
In	its	portion	referring	to	the	material	phase	the	model	then	accounts	for	the	
acceleration	of	the	expansion	([4],[5],[6]).	The	mainstream	model	ΛCDM	predicts	an	
exponential	acceleration	that	results	from	the	constancy	of	the	negative	energy	density	
associated	with	the	cosmological	constant	Λ.	In	the	proposed	model	the	negative	energy	
is	that	of	negative	mass.	It	decreases	as	it	expands.	The	evolution	of	the	scale	factor	of	
positive	mass	(39)	then	tends	towards	an	asymptote,	reflecting	a	linear	expansion	as	a	
function	of	time..		
The	magnitude	values	as	a	function	of	distance,	corresponding	to	this	model,	were

the	universe	into	a	single	entity,	the	negative	mass.

If	we	assume	that	this	era	can	still	be	described	by	FLRW	metrics	we	get	
	.	If	
in	this	era	the	dynamic	is	always	dominated	by	the	content	of	the	universe	in	negative	
energy	we	would	always	have	a	positive	acceleration	in	the	sector	of	positive	masses	:	
	(40)																																																															
At	this	stage	no	explanation	is	given	for	the	very	important	asymmetry	between	the	two	
cosmic	entities.	In	the	next	article	the	origin	of	this	asymmetry	will	be	explained	and	
modelled,	starting	from	a	totally	symmetrical	initial	situation.	This	extension	of	the	
model	will	explain	in	passing	the	extreme	homogeneity	of	the	early	universe,	without	
using	the	inflation	model,	and	will	provide	an	alternative	interpretation	of	the	
fluctuations	of	the	CMB,	the	cosmological	radiation	background.		
Let	us	now	go	back	to	the	description	provided	by	the	model	of	its	material-dominated	
era	and	see	what	results	from	it.

negative	mass	content	( ρ >> ρ	).	The	Jeans	times	of	the	two	species	then	differ:		
	(43)																																					
It	is	therefore	the	negative	mass	that	first	forms	a	regular	series	of	conglomerates,	confining	
the	positive	mass	in	the	residual	space,	thus	giving	it	a	lacunar,	alveolar	structure:

It	would	be	very	interesting	to	be	able	to	resume	this	simulation	work,	in	3D	with	the	
current	computers,	to	which	we	unfortunately	do	not	have	access.	This	diagram,	where	
positive	mass	material	is	distributed	in	the	manner	of	joined	soap	bubbles,	causes	filaments	
to	form	at	the	junction	of	three	cells,	the	clusters	at	the	junction	of	four.	This	pattern	also	
leads	to	a	different	mode	of	galaxy	formation.	When	this	very	large-scale	structure	is	formed,	
immediately	after	decoupling,	the	negative	mass	conglomerates	exert	a	significant	counter-
pressure	on	the	matter,	which	is	compressed	along	plates.		The	result	is	a	sudden	heating.	
But	the	flat	structure	allows	a	dissipation	of	this	thermal	energy	by	radiation,	which	
destabilizes	the	environment	and	serves	as	a	trigger	for	the	birth	of	galaxies.		
	11	)	The	Great	Repeller.	
In	2017	[16]	a	3D	cartography	of	the	universe	has	been	published,	located	in	a	cube	of	
one	and	a	half	billion	light	years	on	the	side,	containing	hundreds	of	thousands	of	

	
14	
galaxies.	At	this	scale	the	speed	of	expansion	of	the	galaxies	reaches	20,000	km/s.	The	
authors	were	able	to	determine	the	proper	motions	of	these	galaxies	by	subtracting	
from	the	velocity	measurements	the	velocity	corresponding	to	Hubble's	law.	It	was	
already	known	for	a	long	time	that	there	was	a	region	of	space,	called	the	Great	Attractor,	
towards	which	the	galaxies	seemed	to	converge.	But	the	analysis	revealed	the	existence,	
in	the	diametrically	opposite	direction,	600	million	light-years	away	from	our	galaxy,	of	
an	empty	region	that	seemed	to	push	galaxies	in	all	directions.	This	totally	empty	
portion	of	space	was	given	the	name	Great	Repeller..			
	

Fig.7	:	The	so-called	Great	Repeller.		

	
		Proponents	of	the	hypothesis	of	the	existence	of	dark	matter,	of	positive	mass,	have	
imputed	such	a	phenomenon	as	being	due	to	a	vast	gap	in	the	general	distribution	of	this	
medium	of	unknown	nature.	But	gravitational	instability	generates	conglomerates	of	
matter,	not	gaps.	The	alternative	interpretation	resulting	from	the	present	model	
attributes	this	phenomenon	to	the	presence	of	a	conglomerate	of	negative	mass,	
invisible	because	it	emits	photons	of	negative	energy.	These	objects	decrease	the	
luminosity	of	distant	sources	by	negative	gravitational	lens	effect	and,	in	fact,	galaxies	
with	high	redshift	(	z	>	7	)	are	classically	considered	as	dwarfs.	We	think	that	they	are	
similar	to	nearby	galaxies	but	that	it	is	this	effect	that	makes	them	appear	as	dwarfs.	
Future	advances	in	observational	means	should	allow	us	to	highlight	a	marked	contrast	
in	magnitude	at	the	center	of	the	formation,	allowing	us	to	evaluate	the	diameter	of	the	
conglomerate.	If	such	a	contrast,	very	localized,	is	found,	it	will	be	necessary	to	abandon	
the	interpretation	by	a	gap	in	the	dark	matter.	From	this	angle	the	model	is	thus	
falsifiable.		At	this	stage	the	model	is	an	alternative	to	the	ΛCDM	model	with	the	same	
percentage	of	visible	matter

	12	–	Confirmations	at	the	level	of	galaxies	and	galaxy	clusters.		
As	shown	by	the	simulations	[15]	built	from	the	interaction	laws	and	the	hypothesis	of	
the	dominance	of	the	negative	mass,	the	two	populations	are	mutually	exclusive.	When	
galaxies	form,	negative	mass	immediately	invades	the	space	between	them.	These	
galaxies	then	occupy	gaps	in	the	distribution	of	negative	mass	which,	exerting	a	counter-
pressure	on	them,	ensures	their	confinement.	This	confinement	force	makes	possible	
high	rotational	speeds	at	the	periphery.	Confer	the	curve	of	figure	1.	These	gaps	in	the	
negative	mass	are	equivalent	to	the	action	of	a	positive	mass,	images	of	these	gaps	with	
an	inverted	mass	sign.	They	thus	generate	strong	gravitational	lens	effects,	in	the	
vicinity	of	galaxies	and	clusters,	and	endow	these	clusters	with	escape	velocities	that	
exceed	the	value	calculated	using	only	the	visible	mass	of	the	cluster.

in	a	steady	state,	to	the	Poisson	equation	we	obtain	systems	of	differential	equations	
from	which	we	can	produce	an	exact	solution	thanks	to	the	power	of	the	calculation	of

		A	rotational	movement	is	then	introduced	as	a	solid	body.	The	image	below	is	extracted	
from	the	results	of	a	2D	simulation	carried	out	in	1992	at	the	DESY	laboratory	in	
Hamburg	by	Frédéric	Descamp,	then	a	student.	At	the	end	of	a	few	turns	constituting	a	
transitory	regime,	a	barred	spiral	galaxy	was	formed,	lasting	for	thirty	turns,	which	was	
then	of	the	order	of	the	age	of	the	universe.

		The	evolution	of	the	kinetic	moment	reflects	a	strong	dynamic	friction	effect	with	a	
slowing	down	of	the	rotational	motion	of	the	galaxy.	At	the	same	time,	the	velocity	
profile	is	modified.		
		

	
Fig.12	:	Kinetic	momentum	evolution	(1992	:	2x10,000	points)	

		Galaxies	are	non-collision	systems.	Therefore	the	transfer	of	momentum	and	energy	
does	not	occur	through	particle	encounters.	This	tells	us	how	non-collisional	systems	
evolve:	through	the	appearance	of	density	waves.	In	this	case	the	galaxy	made	of	
positive	masses	interacts	with	its	negative	mass	environment	through	the	density	waves	
that	form	within	it.	These	waves	have	their	counterpart	in	the	world	of	negative	masses.	
The	fact	that	spiral	structures,	artificially	introduced	as	initial	conditions	in	the	
simulations	where	only	positive	masses	are	present,	dissipate	is	then	explained	by	the	
fact	that	these	waves	have	no	medium	with	which	to	interact.	Let	us	give	an	analogy.	
When	water	flows	through	the	drain	of	a	bathtub,	when	the	water	thickness	is	low,	
spiral	waves	appear.	They	result	from	the	increased	incidence	of	frictional	forces	on	the	
bottom	of	the	bathtub.	If	these	frictional	forces	were	to	disappear,	so	would	the	spiral	
waves,	which	would	then	lose	their	purpose.	These	waves	are	analogous	to	shock	waves,	
because	the	rotational	speed	of	the	fluid	then	exceeds	the	speed	of	propagation	of	
surface	waves.	It	is	the	same	for	galaxies	where	the	local	value	of	the	rotational	velocity	
exceeds	the	average	value	of	the	residual	velocity	(equivalent	for	galaxies,	of	the	thermal	
agitation	velocity	in	a	fluid).	Unfortunately,	these	simulations	could	only	be	continued	in	
this	laboratory	for	a	few	months,	as	the	student	was	quickly	called	to	order	by	his	
hierarchy.	At	the	time,	the	Marseille	observatory	had	appropriate	computing	resources,	
but	we	were	unable	to	access	them.	Attempts	to	publish	in	all	the	specialized	journals	
resulted	in	the	answer	"sorry,	we	don't	publish	speculative	works".	After	a	few	years	we	
abandoned	this	direction	of	research.

			14	–	The	nature	of	this	negative	mass.	The	primordial	antimatter.		
	According	to	the	generally	accepted	pattern,	matter	and	antimatter	are	formed	from	
radiation.	As	S.	Weinberg	wrote	in	his	famous	book	"the	first	three	minuts",	at	that	time	
the	universe	was	filled	by	"different	types	of	radiations",	in	the	sense	that	the	synthesis	
reactions	of	the	matter-antimatter	pair	from	radiation	followed	one	another	at	a	rapid	
rate,	then	their	annihilation	by	giving	back	the	same	radiation,	in	a	situation	of	"detailed	
balancing".	With	the	expansion	the	radiation	is	no	longer	energetic	enough	to	give	birth	
to	the	pairs	and	the	annihilations	take	over.	The	fact	that	one	pair	in	a	billion	survived	
remains	unexplained.	In	1967	the	Russian	Andrei	Sakharov	suggested	[20]	the	existence	
of	two	universes,	having	in	common	only	the	initial	singularity,	the	Big	Bang.	In	one	of	
the	universes,	ours,	the	synthesis	of	matter	from	quarks	would	have	been	slightly	faster	
than	that	of	antimatter	from	antiquarks.	At	the	time	of	this	great	annihilation	would	
have	remained	this	remnant	of	matter,	associated	with	its	equivalent	in	antiquarks,	in	a	
3/1	ratio,	both	being	drowned	in	the	photons	resulting	from	the	annihilations.	Inverse	
situation	in	this	twin	universe	where	one	would	count	a	remainder	of	antimatter	
associated	with	its	equivalent	in	quarks,	always	in	a	3/1	ratio.	In	order	to	maintain	a	
kind	of	generalized	symmetry	A.Sakharov	also	suggested	when	in	this	other	universe	the	
arrow	of	time	is	reversed	(T-symmetry),	as	well	as	the	orientation	of	space	(P-
symmetry).		But	he	had	not	envisaged	an	interaction	between	these	two	sheets	of	
universes.

Topologically,	one	can	envisage	a	folding	of	the	hypersurface	according	to	a	M4	manifold	
with	two	folds.

		By	the	way,	if	the	Big	Bang	punctual	singularity	is	replaced	by	a	tubular	bridge,	such	a	
configuration	brings	an	original	answer	to	the	question	"what	was	the	Big	Bang"	(or	
"what	was	there	before	Planck's	time")	
	

	

	

	

	

Fig15	:	A	space	bridge	replaces	the	point-like	sungularity.		

		Is	there	a	connection	between	the	model	on	the	previous	pages	and	this	question	of	time	
reversal?	The	answer	is	positive.	It	should	be	understood	that	it	is	the	inversion	of	the	
time	coordinate,	not	an	inversion	of	the	direction	of	travel	along	geodesics,	i.e.	of	the	
proper	time.	This	question	of	"T-symmetry"	is	present	in	the	Quantum	Theory	of	Fields	
[21]	where	we	find	operators	T	and	P	for	time	and	space	inversions.	Apart	from	these	
Quantum	Mechanics	considerations,	this	possible	inversion	of	space	and	time	
coordinates	belongs	to	Lorentz's	group,	axiomatically	defined	by:

	-	Lt	:	Elements	reversing	time	(	T-symmetry)	
	-	Lst	:	Elements	reversing	time	and	space	(PT-symmetry)

	If	we	consider	that	physics	is	limited	to	the	declination	of	possible	movements	
corresponding	to	the	restricted	Poincaré	group,	to	the	orthochronous	subgroup,	then	
Minkowski's	space	is	populated	only	by	orthochronous	movements,	traversed	in	a	past-
future	direction,	of	energy	and	positive	mass.		
	The	various	movements	are	declined	by	making	act	on	the	dual	of	the	Lie	algebra	of	the	
group,	on	its	space	of	the	moments	the	relations	of	the	group:		
	(58)																																								
		
	which	are	the	equations	(13.107)	of	reference	[22].	But	if	we	opt	for	the	complete	group	
this	becomes:		
	(59)																																								  
	
 ( λ= −1)	results	in	PT-symmetry.	We	then	observe	that	the	antichronal	elements,	which	
then	inscribe	in	Minkowski's	space	movements	resulting	in	the	inversion	of	time,	also	
inverts	the	energy	E	and	the	pulse	p,	which	make	up	the	quadrivector	P	(reference	[22],	
equation	(16.67)).:		
	
(60)																																																														
	and,	beyond	that,	due	to	the	fact	that	E	=	mc2,	inverts	the	mass.	This	represents	a	first	
step	in	the	identification	of	the	present	model	with	that	of	A.Sakharov.	To	go	further,	one	
must	refer	to	the	geometrical	definition	of	antimatter	symmetry	[23].	Space-time	must	
then	be	given	an	additional	dimension	ζ		(Kaluza	space).	Starting	from	the	Poincaré	
orthochronous	group	we	have	the	first	extension	of	the	group	:

Along	this	fifth	dimension	a	simple	translation	ζ→ζ +φ	takes	place.	These	translations	
thus	constitute	a	one-parameter	subgroup.	Noether's	theorem	will	thus	make	that	this

have	quantum	charges	null	or	equal	to	+1.		The	symmetry	 ( µ= −1)	leads	to	the	
inversion	of	all	quantum	charges,	i.e.	a	C-symmetry.	This	inversion	of	the	direction	of	
travel	of	all	the	additional	dimensions	 ζi	thus	represents	the	geometrical	interpretation	
of	matter/antimatter	symmetry	[23].	Among	these	sets	of	motions	there	are	some	for	
which	all	quantum	charges	are	zero	and	which	correspond	to	positive	energy	photons.		
	In	Sakharov's	idea,	the	two	sheets	of	universe,	disjointed	at	home,	combined	in	the

 ( λ= −1)	is	then	translated	by	a	CPT-symmetry.	Orthochronous	and	antichronous	
movements	correspond	to	movements,	either	of	positive	energy	and	mass,	or	of	negative	
energy	and	mass	of	the	same	particles:	neutrons,	protons,	electrons.	Within	these	
populations	the	duality	of	matter/antimatter	is	present.		
	There	are	therefore	two	types	of	antimatter:		
	
- 
-An	antimatter	of	positive	energy	and	mass,	C-symmetrical	of	the	matter	that	we	
will	call	antimatter	in	the	sense	of	Dirac.		
	
-  An	antimatter	of	negative	energy	and	mass,	PT-symmetrical	to	our	ordinary	
matter,	which	we	call	antimatter	in	the	sense	of	Feynmann.		
	We	thus	give	substance	to	Andrei	Sakharov's	idea.	If	the	rates	of	production	of	matter	
and	antimatter	in	the	two	entities	were	different,	this	determines	the	nature	of	negative	
mass	matter.	It	is	therefore:		
	
-  antiprotons	
-  antineutrons	
-  anti-electrons	
	
of	negative	energy	and	mass,	mixed	with	photons	of	negative	energy	and	a	remnant,	in	a	
3/1	ratio,	of	negative	energy	quarks.	These	particles,	emitting	negative	energy	photons,	
are	not	detected	by	our	optical	instruments.

We	can	suppose	that	in	this	negative	world	a	primordial	nucleosynthesis	will	take	place,	
giving	rise	to	anti-helium	and	anti-lithium	of	negative	mass.	But	after	decoupling	these	
atoms	are	formed	spheroidal	conglomerates,	comparable	to	immense	proto-stars.	The	
cooling	time	increasing	with	the	mass	of	the	objects,	that	of	these	protostars	exceeds	the	
age	of	the	universe.	These	objects	slowly	lose	energy	by	emitting	negative	energy	
photons	in	the	red	and	infrared	range,	like	protostars.	But	this	negative	world	will	not	
generate	any	galaxies	or	stars	and	will	not	be	able	to	synthesize	heavy	atoms.	No	planet	
will	be	able	to	form	and	life	will	be	absent.

		16	–	Opening	of	a	new	research	field	in	Quantum	Mechanics	[24].		
	It	is	well	known	that	the	equations	of	relativistic	quantum	mechanics	(Klein-Gordon,	
Dirac)	naturally	highlight	negative	energy	states.	They	have	always	been	eliminated	by	
considering	that	they	lead	to	negative	probability	densities.	The	solution	that	physicists	
have	found	is	then	to	replace,	in	a	rather	artificial	way	it	must	be	admitted,	the	so-called	
probability	densities	by	charge	densities:	this	is	the	birth	of	antiparticles	(in	the	
commonly	accepted	sense).	
	
However,	if	we	look	a	little	closer	at	these	probability	densities,	we	see	that	they	can	be	
reinterpreted	as	real	probabilities,	positive,	if	we	consider	that	negative	energy	states	
are	also	associated	with	negative	masses.	This	is	particularly	striking	with	the	Klein-
Gordon	density,	which	involves	the	ratio	
(67)																																																																			
Probabilistic	interpretation	is	therefore	compatible	with	negative	energy	states	
provided	that	energies	and	mass	are	simultaneously	negative.	And	how	could	it	have	
been	otherwise	with	Einstein's	relation	at	rest	E	=m	c2	?	Thus	quantum	mechanics	is	the	
ideal	ground	for	reintegrating	negative	energies.	However,	the	consequences	must	be	
discerned.	One	of	them	is	that	the	temporal	reversal	operator	will	henceforth	be	
considered	as	a	linear	and	unitary	operator	[24].		
We	know,	in	fact,	that	a	symmetry	operator	must	necessarily	be	:			
	
-	Linear	and	unitary	(LU)	
	
-	Anti-linear	and	anti-unitary	(AA)	
It	is	customary	to	choose,	for	a	spatial	inversion	P,	the	choice	LU	and	for	a	temporal	
inversion	T	the	choice	AA.	Thus,	the	action	of	these	discrete	symmetries	on	the	
fundamental	operators	of	quantum	mechanics	as	well	as	on	the	imaginary	i	can	be	
summarized	by:	
(68a)																																						   P: !x → − !x , !p ≡ −i"
∇ → − !p , i → i		
(68b)																																				   T: !x → !x , !p ≡ −i"
∇ → − !p , i → − i	
The	fundamental	relationship	of	quantum	mechanics:		
⎤⎦ = i !δj k		
(69)																																																																				
is	then	invariant	under	(68a)	as	well	as	under	(68b).		
Moreover,	the	symmetry	  PT( t → − t , i → − i )thus	chosen	ensures	the	invariance	of	the	
energies

	(70)																																																																		
Positive	energies,	if	we	limit	ourselves	to	them,	therefore	remain	exclusively	positive.	On	
the	contrary,	in	[24]	we	have	opted	for	the	choice	LU,	for	the	two	inversions,	which	leads	
to	the	following	result:		
(71a)																																					   P: !x → − !x , !p ≡ −i"
∇ → − !p , i → i	
	(71b)																																			   T: !x → !x , !p ≡ −i"
∇ → !p , i → i	
both	ensuring	the	invariance	of	(67).	The	major	difference	is	that	the	symmetry	PT	leads	
this	time	to	a	change	of	sign	at	the	level	of	the	energies:	
∂t → − H		
(72)																																																								
There	is	nothing	to	prevent,	physically,	mathematically	and	from	a	probabilistic	point	of	
view,	to	consider	these	negative	energy	states	as	long	as	they	are	assigned	a	negative	
mass.		Moreover,	it	even	seems	that	this	additional	possibility	is	more	rigorous	if	we	
stick	to	mathematics,	since	implying	that	T	is	linear,	it	is	in	agreement	with	its	usual	
realization	(cf.	[28]	Eq	(2.3.16),	p.	58,	for	example):

	17	–	Conclusion	
This	work	suggests	a	complete	upheaval	of	cosmology,	as	well	as	an	extension	of	
theoretical	physics	to	the	field	of	negative	energies.	It	is	a	real	paradigm	shift.	While	
authors	will	easily	be	able	to	place	in	journals	articles	that	can	be	qualified	as	chimerical,	
containing	a	certain	number	of	buzzwords,	without	these	leading	to	any	model	and	any	
agreement	with	observation,	if	we	do	not	want	this	article	to	be	immediately	rejected,	
simply	because	its	validity	will	seem	so	unlikely	to	the	editor	of	the	journal	that	he	will	
refuse	to	submit	it	to	a	referee,	it	is	necessary	hereafter	to	recall	the	rigor	of	its	
construction	and	the	mass	of	observational	confirmations	that	accompany	it:				
-	We	have	shown	that	the	introduction	of	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	model	
was	only	possible	by	switching	to	a	bimetric	system	corresponding	to	a	system	of	two	
coupled	field	equations.	This	was	the	only	way	to	escape	the	runaway	effect	and	to	
restore	the	principles	of	equivalence	and	action-reaction.	In	the	physical	extension	of	a	
previous	mathematically	coherent	work	by	S.	Hossenfelder	[11],	we	have	constructed	a	
model	where	the	Newtonian	approximation	leads	to	the	following	interaction	scheme:	
	

The	masses	of	the	same	signs	attract	each	other	according	to	Newton's	law.		
	
The	masses	of	opposite	signs	repel	each	other	according	to	"anti-Newton".	

	

	
27	
-	The	fact	that	negative	masses,	of	negative	energy,	emit	photons	of	negative	energy,	
which	our	instruments	cannot	capture,	explains	why	certain	contents	of	the	universe	
escape	observation.		
	
-	Using	the	theory	of	dynamic	groups,	we	have	shown	that	in	this	second	matter,	of	
negative	energy,	matter-antimatter	symmetry	was	also	present.	It	is	suggested	that	this	
one	was	simply	composed	of	the	same	antimatter	elements,	with	negative	masses	and	
energies.		
	
-	Taking	up	the	ideas	formulated	in	1967	by	Andrei	Sakharov,	according	to	which	the	
synthesis	of	the	antimatter	of	antiquarks	would	have	been	faster	than	the	synthesis	of	
the	matter	of	quarks,	in	this	second	population,	we	concluded	that	these	invisible	
elements	did	not	correspond	to	dark	matter	of	positive	mass,	but	to	antimatter	of	
negative	mass:	antiprotons,	antineutrons,	antielectrons,	mixed	with	s	photons	of	
negative	energy	and	a	residue	of	quarks	of	negative	energy,	which	resolves	the	paradox	
of	the	non-observation	of	primordial	antimatter.		
-	We	then	constructed	an	exact	solution,	based	on	the	hypothesis	(which	will	be	justified	
in	a	later	article)	of	the	prevalence	of	negative	masses.	This	solution	gives	a	very	good	
agreement	with	data	from	700	type	Ia	supernovae.	The	acceleration	of	the	cosmic	
expansion	is	thus	explained,	without	using	the	cosmological	constant	Λ	.		
-	Since	negative	mass	has	negative	energy,	it	takes	the	place	of	this	unidentified	dark	
energy.	It	is	not	vacuum	energy	and	it	simply	corresponds	to	a	contribution	of	negative	
energy	quantum	states.		
-	We	have	shown	that	these	negative	energy	states	emerge	naturally	from	Dirac's	
equation.	An	approach	that	opens	up	major	perspectives	in	Quantum	Mechanics.		
-	Considering	that	the	negative	mass	content	is	negligible	in	the	vicinity	of	the	Sun,	the	
conclusion	is	that	the	model	is	in	agreement	with	local	relativistic	observations:	Mercury	
perihelion	advance,	deviation	of	light	rays	by	the	mass	of	the	Sun.		
-	Still	according	to	the	hypothesis	of	the	dominance	of	a	negative	mass	content,	we	have	
shown	that	the	latter	is	the	first	to	form	a	set	of	spheroidal	conglomerates	which,	by	
pushing	matter	back	into	interstitial	space,	give	it	a	lacunar	structure.		
-	This	pattern	of	large-scale	structure	formation	suggests	a	new	pattern	of	galaxy	
formation.	The	positive	mass,	compressed	into	plates,	and	thus	heated,	can	rapidly	
dissipate	this	energy	in	the	form	of	radiation	and	thus	present	a	favorable	configuration	
for	the	birth	of	galaxies.		
-	We	have	suggested	that	the	recently	discovered	Great	Repeller	(2017)	could	betray	the	
presence	of	a	negative	mass	conglomerate.		
-	Such	objects	would	cause	a	reduction	in	the	magnitude	of	the	objects	in	the	
background.	We	think	that	this	is	the	real	reason	for	the	low	magnitude	of	galaxies	at	z	
>7.		

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

	
28	
-	We	say	that	future	progress	in	measurements	referring	to	distant	objects	should	make	
it	possible	to	determine	the	diameter	of	such	a	conglomerate	by	highlighting	locally	an	
important	contrast	in	magnitude.		
	
-	We	suggest	that	these	conglomerates,	composed	of	anti-hydrogen	and	anti-helium	of	
negative	mass,	would	behave	like	immense	proto-stars	with	a	cooling	time	greater	than	
the	age	of	the	universe.	Thus,	the	fusion	could	not	start.	These	objects	would	produce	
neither	galaxies,	nor	stars,	nor	planets,	nor	atoms	heavier	than	those	of	which	they	are	
made.		
-	Life	would	be	absent	in	this	negative	world.		
-	On	a	smaller	scale,	the	negative	gravitational	lens	effect	due	to	a	negative	mass	
environment,	which	ensures	the	confinement	of	galaxies,	explains	the	importance	of	the	
gravitational	lens	effects	measured	in	their	vicinity.		
	
-	Same	thing	to	explain,	in	clusters,	the	agitation	velocities	of	galaxies,	higher	than	their	
liberation	velocity	calculated	on	the	basis	of	the	mass	of	the	cluster,	deduced	from	the	
observations.	The	negative	mass	environment	is	again	responsible	for	this	confinement	
effect.		
-	This	configuration	also	explains	the	flat	shape,	at	the	periphery,	of	the	rotation	curves	
of	the	galaxies.		
-	We	provide	a	model	of	a	spheroidal	galaxy,	built	on	the	basis	of	two	Vlasov	equations	
coupled	by	the	Poisson	equation.	This	elliptical	solution	has	a	"vertex"	
	
-	Using	this	model	as	a	support	for	numerical	simulations,	it	was	possible	to	model	the	
birth	of	a	barred	spiral	galaxy,	which	lasts	for	thirty	revolutions.		
	
-	This	explains	why	simulations	carried	out	by	other	authors	had	led	to	the	rapid	
dissipation	of	the	spiral	arms,	artificially	introduced	under	the	initial	conditions.	These	
structures	represent	the	way	in	which	dissipative	processes	take	place	in	these	systems	
without	collision,	reflecting	an	exchange	of	energy	and	momentum	through	density	
waves	present	in	both	systems.	If	there	is	no	second	system	to	interact	with,	the	spiral	
waves	disappear.		
-	In	addition,	it	was	stated	at	the	end	of	the	paper	that	the	description	of	the	radiative	
age	and	the	explanation	of	the	establishment	of	this	strong	asymmetry	would	be	present	
in	a	future	paper.

We	are	looking	for	the	dual	of	the	group's	action	on	its	Lie	algebra.	The	element	of	this	
Lie	algebra	depends	on	11	parameters.		
	(f)																												 
The	moment	space	of	the	group	will	thus	be	a	vector	space	of	dimension	11.	It	can	be	put	
in	the	form	of	an	antisymmetric	matrix	M	of	format	(4,4),	depending	on	six	parameters,	
a	quadrivector	P	and	a	scalar	q.	The	duality	can	thus	be	ensured	by	the	constancy	of	the	
scalar:	
(g)																																																				 
Ce	qui	donne	:	
(h)			 
It	comes	immediately:		
(i)																																																																	  q = λµq'	
	(j)																																														 
t P = tP' tL → P = LP'	
	We	know	that	we	can	perform	a	circular	permutation	in	the	trace:		
	(k)																																											 Tr( M' t LωL) = Tr( LM' t Lω)	
	The	identification	on	the	 ω	terms	gives	
	(l)																																							
Tr( L M' tLω) + tP tLωC		
t P tLωC	is	the	scalar	product	of	the	row	vector	 t Pby	the	column	vector	
The	term	 
tLωC.	We	can	therefore	write,	after	having	performed	a	circular	permutation	in	the	
trace	
	(j)																																																 
By	making	a	circular	permutation	in	the	trace.	Thus	the	equation	(l)	provides:

Knowing	that	the	trace	of	the	product	of	a	symmetrical	matrix	by	an	antisymmetrical	
matrix	is	equal	to	zero:		
(l)																																																	 
It	remains:		
(m)																				 
Which	provides	the	last	equation	of	the	group's	action	on	its	moment:	
(n)																																													 M = LM' tL + C P' tL − LP' tC	
We	make	the	inversion	parameter	reappear	by	 L = λLo	and	group	the	results	together	
		(o)																																																																	 q = λµq'	
(p)																																							 M = Lo M' tLo + λC P' TLo − λLo P' tC											
(r)																																																															 P' = λLo P							
P	is	the	energy-impulsions	4-vector	:		
(s)																																																											
Equations	(o),(p),(r)	represent	an	extension	of	equations	13.107	of	reference	[27].	The	
relation	(r)	makes	it	possible	to	find	Souriau's	relation	([27]	page	190,	equations	14.67	).	
The	inversion	of	time	 ( λ= −1)	leads	to	the	inversion	of	energy	and	of	the	impulse	
vector	  
!p	.	The	matrix	M	depending	on	six	parameters	can	be	decomposed	into	two	
vectors.	The	vector	f	is	what	Souriau	calls	the	pass	and	s	is	the	spin.	
	(t)
																																														 
The	passage	f	is	not	an	intrinsic	attribute	of	the	motion	because	it	can	be	cancelled	by	a	
change	of	variable	accompanying	the	particle.	Only	the	spin	remains,	of	which	Souriau	
demonstrated	in	1970	its	geometrical	nature.	By	cancelling	the	spatio-temporal	
translation	C	the	relation	(p),	where	λ		does	not	appear,	shows	that	the	inversion	of
