Abstract 
We extend the Poincaré group to the complex Minkowski space-time. Special 
attention is paid to the corresponding algebra that we achieve through ma-
trices as well as differential operators. We also point out the generalizations of 
the two Casimir operators.

1. Introduction 
Complex  numbers  are  known  to  be  powerful  mathematical  tools  to  describe 
physical phenomena. Usually, their role is limited to intermediate calculations 
and they are not welcome in final results. However, sometimes these results do 
depend on these numbers in the sense that they explicitly appear in the final eq-
uations. 

To our knowledge, complex energies first appeared as intrinsic components of 
the  physical  paradigm  in  the  relativistic  Kemmer-Duffin-Petiau  equation  [1], 
dealing with vector mesons. When they are subject to a sufficiently strong mag- 

netic field (

), their energies, whose squares are given by1 [2]

More recently, some cosmological models [3] used an imaginary time. They

all  conjecture  a  join  between  areas  of  imaginary  time  and  areas  of  real  time. 
Somehow,  real  time  emerges  from  imaginary  time,  the  latest  being  helpful  to 
remove gravitational singularities. 

This idea is clearly not unanimous because an imaginary time is most of the 
time seen as non-physical, even heretical. Also voices [4] rose to emphasize the 
inconsistency of such a transition between imaginary and real times which still 
remains vague. Some attempts have been performed to specify it. For instance, 
in [5], imaginary time stands before the Planck time and is related to imaginary 
energies seen as pure information. Thus, an imaginary time is compatible with 
the fact that time does not go by and the information, which in a sense, replaces 
matter, is retained until time rotates and becomes real. To cite the authors of [5], 
this imaginary time is analogous to the moment when the music is burned on a 
CD but not yet listened to. It can wait indefinitely until one decides to put the 
CD in a drive: time then becomes real and follows its arrow. 

We think that imaginary time and, by extension, complex space-time coordi-
nates, are one of the most promising tracks for generalizing relativistic quantum 
mechanics. 

One of the advances of complex numbers in this direction is the concept of 
Minkowski  complex  space-time.  A  first  attempt  with  emphasis  on  specific  as-
pects of twistors has been performed in [6]. In the present paper, we come back 
to this idea but with a different metric. In fact, the metric considered in [6] in-
volved a complex space-time interval while we want to limit ourselves to a real 
one.  We  could  compare  this  to  the  wavefunction  role  in  usual  quantum  me-
chanics. Indeed this function, although complex, appears on a real form, like the 
square of its modulus, when physics concepts must be discussed. 

More precisely, the key idea involved by our proposal of (3 + 1)-D complex 
Minkowski manifold is to extend spatial as well as time coordinates to complex 
numbers with a Hermitian metric given by

Here  the  notation  xµ   refers  to  the  complex  conjugate  of  xµ  while  the  diag 
notation means that we consider a diagonal matrix. 

The purpose of this paper is to investigate this (3 + 1)-D Minkowski manifold 
and, in particular, to see what would the Poincaré group/algebra become when 
coordinates are complex numbers. 

To do so, we first have to consider a (6 + 2)-D real manifold by considering 
real as well as imaginary parts of the involved complex numbers. This is the sub-
ject of the next Section. Then, we use the corresponding coadjoint action to put 
in evidence the transformation laws on  momenta which  are nothing else than 
basis operators for the algebra. Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the differential 
realization of these momenta in the real as well as the complex cases. The trans-

mir operators in Section 7 and finally conclude in Section 8.

it  [8]  to  Kaluza  5-D  space-time.  By  analogy  with  what  has  been  done  in  the 
  case,  we  define  a  torsor  µ  of  the  extended  Poincaré  group  by  the

The usual Poincaré algebra is recovered through Equations (42a), (43k) and 
(43o). It is now realized through complex variables and corresponds to the pro-

posal  made  by  one  of  us  in  [8].  We  can  also  recognize  the  algebra 
through the operators (42a)-(42b) and their commutation relations (43a)-(43c).

6. Transformations of the Extended Poincaré Group 
Now that the algebraic content is clear, let us come to the group approach sub-
tended by the transformations (29). 

We  recognize  in  (29)  eight  real  translations  associated  with  α,  or,  in  an 
equivalent  way,  four  complex  ones.  The  contributions  of  the  matrix L  can  be 
understood as follows: 

1) Twelve transformations of “boost” type i.e. “rotations” between a (real or 

imaginary) time component and three (real or imaginary) space components: 

with 

j

These equations are remarkable in the sense that they show that the complexifi-
cation  enables  the  connection  between  the  Lorentz  components.  Indeed  we

. Each of the three last ones is related to the first one by acting on 
−
it with a discrete symmetry, either the parity operator P or the time-reversal op-
erator T. Two objects in “mirror symmetry” are necessarily linked by a rotation 
in a higher dimensional space and that’s exactly what happens  here: the com-
plexification allows these dimensions to exist in order to relate a coordinate and 
its opposite (which corresponds to  µµθ = π ).

Similar discussions can be made with the complex algebra. We will just men-

tion  here  that  if  the 
boosts or rotations on the four complex coordinates  xµ, the other 12 ones (cor-
IN µν) realize, in addition, a complex 
responding to exponentiations of  N µν  or 
conjugation. It is actually the reason why, despite of the fact that the quadratic

  are 
not isomorphic.

7. The Casimir Operators 
The  number  of  Casimir  operators  associated  with  the  inhomogeneous  group 
ISO
  (which  is  the  one  subtended  by  our  approach  in  the  real  space)  is 
equal to 4 [10].

We put here explicitely in evidence two of them i.e. the ones generalizing the 

two Casimirs of the Poincaré algebra. 

The first Casimir operator is

It is indeed invariant under the transformation (26). Another way to be con-

vinced of the form (48) is to rewrite it in details

and verify that it commutes with each of the 36 operators of the extended Poin-
caré algebra by using Equations (38)-(39) or (43k)-(43o) depending on whether 
we choose to work with eight real coordinates or four complex ones. 

By analogy with the real case, we can thus define the mass of a particle living 

in the complex Minkowski space-time by

This is the complex version of the famous Einstein relation2  E m=

. 

The second Casimir operator requests more calculations. We indeed need to 

introduce the following 3-rank tensor

It is antisymmetric on the two first indices as well as on the two last ones but is 
(evidently) symmetric on A and C. It thus gives rise to 56 operators.

namely the four components of the Pauli-Lubanski pseudo-vector. No need to 
say  that,  here,  there  is  no  interest  to  go  through  the  dual  to  obtain  a  similar 
writing, as this will lead to a pseudo-tensor of rank 5. 

So let us focus on the operators (52). It is easy (even if laborious) to convince 

ourselves that they are such that

and, consequently, is the second Casimir operator. 

Its  interpretation  goes  through  the  so-called  “little  groups”  technics i.e.  re-
stricting ourselves to particular momenta P. If the rest is considered, only two P

8. Conclusions 
We have extended the Poincaré group as well as its algebra to a complex Min-
kowski space. Beyond the real operators corresponding to transformations of the 
real coordinates, our approach shows that supplementary imaginary as well as 
complex operators appear to form with the previous ones a 36-dimensional real 
or complex algebra according to choosing 8 real coordinates or 4 complex ones. 
What are the unirreps of the extended Poincaré algebra? What physical im-
plications could have this complex algebra? What would be a complex version of 
usual quantum mechanics? 

These questions remain open at this stage and will be the subject of further 

considerations.
