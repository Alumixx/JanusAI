Complex	symplectic	mechanics	:	a	toy	model	for	life	?		

Jean-Pierre	Petit1	
Manaty	Research	Group	
Abstract	:	We	show	that	the	classical	technique	of	the	symplectic	mechanics	can	be	
extended	to	a	complex	Hermitean	space,	giving	a	complex	momentum	map	with	
complex	geometrical	attributes	:	energy,	impulsion,	spin.		
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________	
In	1970	the	mathematician	J.M.Souriau	introduces	symplectic	mechanics	[1].	Starting	
from	the	isometry	group	of	Minkowski	space,	i.e.	the	Poincaré	group	:		
(1)																																																																		
⎠⎟		
where	L	is	the	Lorentz	group,	and	C	the	boost		
		
(2)																																																									
he	computes	the	coadjoint	action	of	the	group	on	the	dual	of	its	Lie	Algebra,	which	gives	
the	following	momentum	map	:		
(3)																																																 M' = L M tL + C tP tL − LP tC		
(4)																																																																						P’	=	L	P		
where		
		
(5)																																																															
So	that	the	Energy	E	,	the	impulsion	p	and	the	spin	(enclosed	in	the	M	matrix)	appear	
like	pure	geometrical	objets,	components	of	the	momentum.		
Surprizingly	this	technique	can	be	easily	extended	to	the	complex	world	[2].

If	we	replace	the	Minkowski	coordinates	 
may	form	the	4D	Hermitean	space,	whose	metric	is	:		
(6)																					 ds2 = dx° *dx° − dx1*dx1 − dx2 *dx2 − dx3*dx3		
This	metric	is	defined	on	a	Hermitean	manifold.		
Let’s	now	consider	the	real	matrix	G	:	
		
(7)																																																				
and	the	complex	Lorentz	group	defined	as	:		
(8)																																																																				 *LG L = G		
*L	stands	for	the	adjoint	of	L.		
One	can	show	easily	that	the	complex	Poincaré	group	
⎠⎟	
(9)																																																																				
where	C	is	th	complex	boost,	is	an	isometry	group	of	the	Hermitean	space	and	can	be	
considered	as	a	complex	dynamic	group.	Surprizingly	all	classical	(matrix)	calculations	
can	be	extended	to	such	complex	framework	by	simply	substituting	the	adjoint	matrices	
tA.	See	the	annex.		
*A	to	the	transpose	matrices	 
As	a	result,	the	complex	momentum	obeys	the	laws	:	
(10)																																																 M' = L M * L + C* P* L − L P*C		
(11)																																																																						P’	=	L	P		
where		
	
(12)																																																													
E	is	a	complex	energy	and	p	a	complex	impulsion.	The	spin,	in	complex	matrix	M,	is	
complex	too.		
The	symplectic	approach	creates	a	link	between	pure	mathematics	and	physics.	In	the	
case	of	such	complex	extension,	what	could	be	its	physical	meaning	?

The	Minkowski	spacetime	can	be	considered	as	the	real	part	of	a	Hermitean	space.	In	
Minkowski	space	time	we	can	consider	the	null	geodesics	as	the	paths	of	photons,	and	
the	non-zero	geodesics	as	the	paths	of	particles	with	spin.		
Notice	that	in	classical	physics	people	only	consider	the	restricted	Poincaré	group,	built	
on	the	restricted	Lorentz	group.	In	effect	the	Lorentz	group,	as	defined	axiomatically	by			
t LG L = L		
(13)																																																																						 
owns	four	connex	components.		
-	 Ln	is	the	neutral	component,	whose	elements	keep	the	orientation	of	time	and	space.		
-	 Ls	elements	invert	space,	not	time.			
-	 Lt	elements	invert	time,	not	space	
-	
Lst	elements	invert	both	time	and	space	
The	first	two	set	form	the	orthochron	subgroup	  Lo{
The	next	two	form	the	antichron	set	  La{
}	
The	restricted	Poincaré	group	is	:		
⎟	
(14)																																																													
The	corresponding	action	on	the	moment	is	:		
(15)																																																 M' = Lo M tLo + C tP tLo − Lo P tC		
(16)																																																																						P’	=	Lo	P		
The	complete	Poincaré	group	can	be	written	as	:		
⎟ with λ= ± 1	
(17)																																																			
which	gives	:		
(18)																																																 M' = Lo M tLo + λC tP tLo − λLo P tC		
(19)																																																																				 P' = λLo P		
From	(19)	we	see	that	the	time	inversion	goes	with	the	inversion	of	the	energy	,	and	
mass.

A	toy	model	for	life.		

	
Newtonian	approximation	gives	the	gravitational	interaction	laws	:	
-  Masses	with	same	sign	mutually	attract	through	«	Newton’s	law	»	
	
-  Masses	with	opposite	signs	mutuelly	repel	through	«	anti-Newton	»	
	
We	may	consider	the	complete	complex	Poincaré	group	:		
⎟ with λ= ± 1	
(26)																																																
where	 Lo	and	C	are	complex	and	λ		real.		
Concentrate	on	the	movement	of	masses	and	photons	in	the	real	part	of	the	Hermitean	
space,	i.e.	the	Minkowski	space.	They	corresponds	to	physical	matter,	moving	in	the	
«	real	physical	world	».		
Now,		consider	the	imaginary	part	of	our	Hermitean	space.	It	becomes	a	«	metaphysical	
space	»,	inhabited	by	imaginary	masses	(positive	and	negative).	.		
The	real	world	is	inhabited	by	real	masses,	positive	and	negative.		They	mutually	repel.	
Gravitational	interaction	makes	them	form	positive	clusters	(galaxies,	clusters	of	
galaxies,	stars,	planets).	Nuclear	interaction	gives	a	wide	set	of	atoms.	Electromagnetic	
forces	produce	molecules	and	biomolecules.		
What	could	we	find	in	our	metaphysical	world	?	We	may	speculate	that	some	interaction	
forces	act,	among	the	different	species.	Let’s	assume	that	positive	imaginary	masses	+	im	
and	negative	imaginary	masses	–im	obey	a	set	of	laws	similar	to	the	one	of	the	real	
matter.	The	will	tend	to	form	clusters.		
Let’s	continue	to	play	with	such	toy	model.	We	decide	that	the	positive	species	would	
represent	«	the	will	»	and	negative	species	the	«	evil	».	We	could	also	imagine	to	
introduce	«	imaginary	carriers	»,	similar	to	photons.	A	very	rich	and	complex	mixture.		
In	the	real	world	positive	and	negative	particles	don’t	glue	together.	The	stand	far	apart.	
This	corresponds	to	the	very	large	structure	of	the	universe	when,	after	the	discoupling,	
negative	mass	clusters	form,	confining	positive	mass	in	the	remnant	place,	which	form	a	
lacunar	structure,	tu	be	compared	to	joint	soap	bubbles	([8],	[11]).		
	The	fate	of	the	real	world	is	ruled	by	physical	laws,	corresponding	to	a	limited	set	of	
equations.

We	could	imagine	that	the	metaphysical	world’s	fate	could	be	ruled	by	unknown	
metaphysical	rules,	that	would	produce	different	kinds	of	structures.	We	could	compar	
some	of	them	to	«	souls	»	or	«	spirits	».		
Now,	what	about	life	?		
In	this	toy	model	a		living	creature	would	be	a	structure	composed	by	a	body,	i.e.	un	
certain	set	of	linked	positive	masses	,	plus	a	soul.	If	the	model	is	based	on	a	5D	complex	
space,	we	may	include	some	metaphysical	electromagnetic	forces	like	interactions		that	
would	help	the	formation	of	complex	objects,	composed	by	the	two	kinds	of	masses,	
positive	imaginary	and	negative	imaginary,	i.e.		made	of	«	will	»	and	«	evil	».		

	
On	the	figure	we	have	figured	two	living	creatures	as	associations	of	(	body	+	soul	).	
Then	the	«	death	»	correponds	to	the	breaking	of	the	link.	Conversely		the	birth	would	
correspond	to	the	making	of	the	link.		
It’s	difficult	to	modelize	conscienceness	based	on	real	matter.	It	could	be	possible	using	
the	imaginary	particles	and	fields,	and	metaphysical	laws	and	interaction	forces.		
We	let	the	reader	to	build	his	own	toy	model.		A	job	for	philosophers.
