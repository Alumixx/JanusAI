Abstract:	In	this	first	part,	we	present	a	documented	historical	background	
about	the	Schwarzschild	solution	to	the	field	equations	of	general	relativity,	
as	originally	considered	by	Karl	Schwarzschild,	as	well	as	Johannes	Droste,	
Hermann	Weyl	and	Albert	Einstein,	in	its	linearized	form.	We	also	detail	how	
David	Hilbert	assumed	this	question,	with	a	pure	imaginary	time.	Finally,	we	
discuss	extensions	of	the	solution	through	analytic	continuation	and	their	
geometry	implications.

Introduction	
The	black	hole	model	remains	a	belief	within	the	scientific	community.	
It	is	true	that	in	the	recent	history	of	science,	the	existence	of	many	objects	
and	phenomena	has	been	conjectured	long	before	they	have	been	effectively	
observed.	Yet	many	of	them	had	a	lot	to	stir	up	skepticism.	An	example	was	
antimatter,	imagined	by	Sir	Arthur	Schuster	in	1898,	theorized	by	Paul	Dirac	
in	1928,	before	the	first	observation	of	positrons	in	1932.	Later,	the	
phenomenon	described	in	1935	by	Einstein,	Podolsky	and	Rosen,	named	the	
EPR	paradox,	was	demonstrated	decades	after	its	authors	presented	it	as	a	
denunciation	of	the	infallibility	of	quantum	mechanics.	
Swiss-American	astrophysicist	Fritz	Zwicky	described	how	massive	stars	
could	violently	end	as	supernovæ,	in	a	memorable	Caltech	lecture	course	in	
1931.	According	to	him,	such	a	star	running	out	of	fusion	fuel	would	end	in	a	
violent	gravitational	collapse	at	an	incredible	high	speed,	converting	its	
potential	energy	into	kinetic	energy.	This	outburst	of	a	very	large	quantity	of	
mass	would	compress	the	internal	iron	core	into	a	totally	new	object:	a	
neutron	star.	

	
2	
This	model	is	at	first	greeted	with	general	skepticism,	and	very	few	scientists	
agree	with	such	a	singular	idea.	But	after	tremendous	efforts,	Zwicky	
managed	to	gradually	demonstrate	the	phenomenon.	
Nowadays,	no	one	would	venture	to	question	the	existence	of	antimatter,	or	
quantum	entanglement	involved	in	the	EPR	paradox,	or	supernovae.	As	for	
astronomical	phenomena,	the	situation	is	very	simple.	The	cosmos	is	vast.	If	
the	supernova	phenomenon	statistically	occurs	in	our	galaxy	at	a	rate	of	only	
one	per	century,	the	extension	to	all	observable	galaxies	brings	their	number	
to	tens	of	thousands.		
Related	to	supernovæ	was	the	question	of	the	existence	of	neutron	stars.	The	
first	ones	were	discovered	in	1967	as	pulsars	(highly	magnetized	rotating	
neutron	stars	acting	as	pulsed	radiation	sources).	The	relation	with	
supernovæ	was	soon	established,	one	of	these	pulsars	being	located	in	the	
middle	of	the	Crab	Nebula,	remnant	of	a	supernova	whose	visible	explosion	
in	1054	is	testified	by	Chinese	records.	Today,	their	number	has	reached	
hundreds	of	samples,	in	every	corner	of	the	galaxy,	including	near	distances.	
No	reasonable	scientist	would	now	doubt	of	their	very	existence.	
But	this	is	not	the	same	at	all	about	stellar	black	holes,	whose	existence	is	
practically	inferred	by	just	one	observation:	the	Cygnus	X-1	binary	system,	
whose	distance	from	us	is	evaluated	at	6,000	light-years.	This	rarity	is	very	
abnormal.	At	such	a	large	distance,	its	estimated	mass	(about	eight	solar	
masses)	could	result	from	cumulative	observational	errors.	
This	very	anomalous	situation	gives	this	hypothetical	object	the	nature	of	a	
belief,	in	conflict	with	the	scientific	method.	
As	for	supermassive	black	holes,	all	that	can	be	said	for	the	moment	is	that	
these	are	very	important	concentrations	of	matter	(hundreds	of	thousands	
to	billions	of	solar	masses)	located	in	the	center	of	galaxies.	They	have	a	very	
large	mass,	but	not	a	very	high	density;	the	one	located	in	the	center	of	Milky	
Way	can	be	represented	by	a	sphere	half	the	solar	system	in	diameter,	filled	
with	matter	having	the	same	density	as	water.	In	any	event	they	are	new	
objects,	which	could	be	the	remainder	of	quasar	phenomena,	but	their	
signature	does	not	allow,	in	its	current	state,	to	name	them	black	holes.	
It	is	therefore	perfectly	licit	today	to	question	the	black	hole	model,	while	
proposing	an	alternative	scenario	to	the	fate	of	a	critical	neutron	star.	Indeed,	
in	X-ray	binaries	for	example,	a	stable	neutron	star	(the	accretor)	can	capture	
material	from	a	companion	star	(the	donor)	and	thus	becomes	at	some	point	
destabilized.	To	refuse	such	a	study	would	be	unscientific	and	would	be	
tantamount	to	the	defense	of	a	dogma.

Prelude	to	the	birth	of	the	black	hole	model	
Before	literally	getting	to	the	heart	of	the	matter,	it	is	necessary	to	situate	the	
context	in	which	Schwarzschild	first	produced	a	nonlinear,	exact	solution	of	
Einstein's	field	equation	in	1916.	In	public's	imagination,	Einstein	got	a	
superhero	origin	story	by	the	media.	Actually,	thanks	to	his	remarkable	
ability	to	assimilate	both	the	mathematics	of	his	time	and	the	palette	of	
physical	phenomena,	he	was	able	to	produce	an	impressive	succession	of	
results,	including	in	1905	the	discovery	of	the	law	of	the	photoelectric	effect.	
But	at	that	time	a	number	of	German	and	Dutch	scientists	followed	this	path	
carefully,	and	were	immediately	able	to	understand	and	interpret	any	
progress	made.	Schwarzschild	was	one	of	them.	
In	1915,	we	find	first	important	texts	resulting	from	the	collaboration-
competition	between	Einstein	and	the	great	mathematician	Hilbert.	In	
November	1915,	Einstein	presented	a	finalized	version	of	his	theory	of	
general	relativity	in	a	series	of	four	papers	at	the	Royal	Prussian	Academy	of	
Sciences	in	Berlin	[1]	[2]	[3]	[4].	At	first,	his	field	equation	is	not	divergence-
free,	but	he	has	the	intuition	that	for	distances	small	enough	and	for	
moderate	velocities	(which	corresponds	to	the	Newtonian	approximation)	
his	equation	should	give	the	corresponding	equations	of	fluid	mechanics,	
namely	the	Euler	conservation	equations.	He	modifies	his	field	equation	to	
make	it	divergence-free	in	[4],	whose	original	title	is:	
	

Fig.	1	–	Einstein's	original	paper,	November	25,	1915	

"The	Field	Equations	of	Gravitation."	

	

			

	
And	here	is	the	corresponding	field	equation:

Einstein	is	obviously	interested	in	phenomena	Newtonian	mechanics	cannot	
explain.	On	November	18,	1915,	he	publishes	a	linearized	solution	of	the	field	
equation	without	a	second	member,	resulting	of	a	null	Ricci	tensor.	[3]	

Fig.	4	–	Einstein	explains	the	perihelion	motion	of	Mercury	on	November	18,	1915.	
	In	this	solution,	Einstein	chooses	to	give	the	value	-1	to	the	determinant	of	
his	metric	solution,	a	hypothesis	Schwarzschild	will	take	again.		

Fig.	5	–Field	equation	with	no	right	hand-side,	and	determinant	-1.

It	is	worth	mentioning,	and	this	will	be	of	great	importance	later	on,	that	
Einstein	opts	for	a	metric	signature	with	a	time	variable	(as	well	as	a	proper	
time)	having	real	values:	

Fig.	6	–	Einstein's	choice	of	a	metric	signature	(	+	–	–	–	).	

	The	solution	of	his	field	equation	is	a	four-dimensional	hypersurface.	It	is	
clear	that	his	choice	of	variable	is	within	  !4	and	the	element	of	length	ds	is	
real.	
In	the	following	excerpt,	he	gives	an	approximate	expression	of	the	metric	
g44,	introducing	a	quantity	α,	a	Greek	letter	that	Schwarzschild	
potential	  
also	choses	to	designate	the	constant	of	integration	of	his	nonlinear	solution	
in	January	1916.

Letters	  x1 , x2 , x3	denote	real	space	coordinates	from	which	he	designates	as	
polar	coordinate	   x1
Using	polar	coordinates,	he	finds	the	Newtonian	area	law:

Going	from	the	variable	 r	to	its	inverse	1/r,	he	expresses	the	form	of	the	
geodesic	solution:		

	

Fig.	9	–	Quasi	Newtonian	solution.	
To	stick	with	the	chronology,	we	have	to	mention	the	communication	
presented	by	the	great	mathematician	Hilbert	at	the	Göttingen	Academy	of	
Sciences,	in	the	session	of	November	20,	1915.	[5]		
He	gradually	got	involved	about	a	possible	mathematization	of	physics	
through	a	variational	approach.	The	same	month	as	Einstein's	presentation	
of	his	finalized	version	of	general	relativity,	Hilbert	presented	a	first	paper	
entitled	"The	Foundations	of	Physics",	extremely	ambitious.	At	that	time,

physics	boils	down	to	two	sets:	gravitation	and	electromagnetism.	Everyone	
thinks	that	the	one	who	would	succeed	uniting	these	two	worlds	(in	what	
will	later	be	called	a	"unified	field	theory")	will	master	all	the	physics	of	his	
time.	This	is	the	meaning	of	Hilbert's	paper.	
Such	a	work	will	be	pursued	by	Einstein,	who	will	also	fail	in	this	venture.	We	
know	today	that	in	order	to	combine	gravitation	and	electromagnetism	
together,	four	dimensions	are	not	enough.	To	begin	with,	a	fifth	dimension	
would	be	mandatory:	Kaluza's	fifth	dimension.		
But	very	quickly,	Hilbert	did	not	feel	satisfied	with	his	article	and	decided	to	
withdraw	it	to	make	changes.1	As	will	be	seen	later,	he	will	present	a	second	
communication	in	December	1916	[6]	and	it	is	this	version,	very	similar	to	
the	first	one,	that	we	will	comment	on.	
At	that	time	of	war,	Karl	Schwarzschild,	43	years	old	and	already	the	father	
of	three	children,	joined	with	the	rank	of	lieutenant,	by	patriotism,	to	fight	on	
the	Russian	front.	He	is	already	an	astronomer	and	a	confirmed	mathema-
tician.	Taking	note	of	Einstein's	paper,	he	publishes	in	January	and	February	
1916,	not	one	article,	but	two,	in	which	he	presents	his	nonlinear	exact	
solution	of	the	field	equation.	[7]	[8]	Here	is	the	title	of	the	first	paper:		

Fig.	10	–	First	Schwarzschild's	paper	on	January	13,	1916	

"On	the	gravitational	field	of	a	mass	point	according	to	Einstein's	theory."	

																																																								
1	Although	Hilbert's	first	communication	was	presented	during	the	session	of	November	20,	1915,	Hilbert	
will	prevent	its	publication	for	months	in	order	to	make	modifications.	In	particular,	he	will	change	the	field	
equation	a	posteriori	to	use	the	divergenceless	version	presented	by	Einstein	on	November	25.	The	final	
version	of	his	paper	will	be	published	in	1916,	keeping	the	date	of	November	20,	1915.	Hilbert	did	not	
"invent	the	field	equation"	five	days	before	Einstein	as	one	can	sometimes	naively	hear	it.	

	

	
He	quickly	situates	his	solution	by	setting	coordinates:		

Fig.	11	–	Schwarzschild	defines	his	coordinates.	

"One	 calls	 t	 the	 time	 and	 x,	 y,	 z	 the	 rectangular	 coordinates".	These	
coordinates	are	real.	If	he	had	opted	for	coordinates	that	could	take	on	
it.	 So	 he	 chooses	 a	
imaginary	 values,	 he	 would	 have	 mentioned	
representation	in	  !3.	Then	he	goes	to	a	polar	coordinate	system,	writing	
  x =r sinθcosϕ,	  y =r sinθsinϕ,	  z =r cosθ		with		
x 2 + y2 + z 2		
																																																													  r =
which	implies	   r ≥ 0,	at	least	for	the	choice	of	a	representation	where	
variables	(	x	,	y	,	z	)	belong	to	 !.	At	this	point,	it	should	be	noted	that	r	is	not	
a	radial	distance,	but	a	simple	space	marker,	a	simple	number.	Schwarzschild	
then	introduces	what	he	calls	an	"auxiliary	quantity"	(Hilfsgröße):		

Fig.	12	–	The	solution	expressed	with	auxiliary	quantity	R.	

9	

	

	

	
10	
In	so	doing,	he	calls	his	constant	of	integration	 α	in	order	to	tally	with	
Einstein's	1915	paper	[3].	Using	this	set	of	variables	   
}	he	
calculates	the	geodesics.	Like	Einstein,	he	notes	that	these	geodesics	are	part	
of	planes	and	he	chooses,	like	him,	the	plane	θ	=	π/2.	It	is	again	with	this	
auxiliary	quantity	R	that	he	expresses	the	area	law:	
	

t , R ,θ,ϕ

{

	

Fig.	13	–	Schwarzschild	calculates	the	geodesics	Φ(R):	eq.	(18)	

	The	same	applies	to	equation	(18)	for	the	expression	of	the	solution	in	the	
form	of	an	integral	based	on	the	variable	x	=	1/r	(and	not	on	the	variable	r)	
as	in	Einstein's	paper.	It	is	clear	that	he	orientates	the	expression	of	his	
solution	to	stick	closely	to	the	Einstein's	result.	
	

	
11	
But	this	detail	is	quite	secondary	to	him,	inasmuch	as	the	conditions	of	
planetary	astronomy	makes	the	two	quantities	practically	equal,	which	he	
notes	a	little	further	on	(Es	ist	also	praktisch	R	mit	r	identisch):		
	

	

"Therefore r is virtually identical to R" 

Fig.	14	–	Schwarzschild's	solution	meets	Einstein's.	

	Translation	of	the	underlined	passage:		
	After	Schwarzschild's	death,	his	work	was	first	presented	to	the	community	
of	mathematicians	by	Frank	[9]	then	quickly	taken	up	by	Droste	[10],	Weyl	
[11]	and	of	course,	Hilbert	[6].		
It	is	the	media,	mostly	American,	that	will	fashion	Einstein's	image	as	an	
isolated	genius,	author	of	a	theory	that	a	tiny	number	of	people	would	have	
been	able	to	understand.	This	does	not	in	any	way	reduce	Einstein's	merits,	
but	he	was	in	fact	at	the	forefront	of	physics,	in	which	a	relatively	large	
number	of	researchers,	mainly	German-speaking,	were	already	involved.	
Among	them,	Schwarzschild.		

	
12	
Scientific	articles	were	then	published	in	German,	and	at	that	time	accessing	
such	work	is	done	by	reading	"offprints",	sample	copies	on	paper,	which	are	
transmitted	by	postal	services.	Subsequently,	the	same	papers	are	made	
available,	grouped	in	books,	but	still	in	German.	It	was	only	in	the	1970s,	
more	than	half	a	century	later,	that	this	documentation	was	translated	in	
English,	and	later	on	made	available	as	PDF	files.	The	modern	distribution	of	
these	files	through	the	Internet	is	something	very	recent.	Only	a	few	decades	
ago,	in	order	to	distribute	simple	copies	of	articles,	researchers	had	to	type	
their	works	on	tracing	papers,	then	use	them	to	expose	a	UV-sensitive	yellow	
sheet.	And	finally,	embedding	the	copies	within	ammonia	vapors	to	reveal	
the	content.	I	personally	experienced	this	technique	in	the	1960s.	The	
scanner,	an	essential	part	of	photocopiers,	will	only	be	put	on	the	market	in	
the	late	1960s.		
All	this	to	tell	the	works	of	Einstein	and	Schwarzschild	have	spread	to	the	
scientific	community	in	the	form	of	commentaries,	not	in	their	original	form.	
However,	one	should	note	that	Droste	[10]	and	Weyl	[11]	chose	the	element	
of	length	as	always	positive,	associated	with	a	metric	signature	(+	-	-	-):		

	

	

Fig.	15	–	Excerpt	of	Weyl's	1917	paper.	

	
13	
Still	in	Weyl's	paper,	we	find	such	a	signature	and	the	mention	of	a	real	and	
essentially	positive	polar	coordinate	r.		

Fig.	16	–	In	Weyl	(1917):	the	polar	coordinate	and	the	signature.	

	Similar	mention	with	Droste,	in	his	paper	communicated	in	English	by	
Hendrik	Lorentz	sixteen	days	after	the	death	of	Schwarzschild,	but	published	
only	the	following	year.	[10]	

	

Fig.	17	–	Droste	specifies	on	May	27,	1916	the	signature	he	chooses.	

	
14	
It	does	not	seem	to	come	to	anyone's	mind	to	extend	this	solution	for	 r <α	
which	would	imply	a	modification	of	the	signature	of	the	metric.	
It	is	then	that	Hilbert	presents	the	second	communication	of	his	long	article	
"The	Foundations	of	Physics":		

Fig.	18	–	Hilbert's	second	communication,	December	23,	1916.	

	In	this	sequel	to	his	first	communication	presented	the	year	before,	he	takes	
his	work	over	and	includes	the	Schwarzschild	solution	published	in	January.	
Hilbert	knows	that	he	died.	Einstein	delivered	a	memorial	lecture	on	Karl	
Schwarzschild	[12]	on	June	29,	1916	at	the	opening	meeting	of	the	Royal	
Prussian	Academy	of	Sciences,	Berlin.	But	Hilbert	does	not	seem	to	focus	
much	on	this	result,	which	appears	to	him	as	a	detail	in	the	vast	scientific	
saga	he	intends	to	carry	out	on	both	gravitation	and	electromagnetism.	Let's	
see	his	mention	of	Schwarzschild's	solution.		
In	his	paper,	Hilbert	mentions	a	central	symmetry	(zentrischsymmetrisch):	

Fig.	19	–	Hilbert's	hypothesis	of	a	central	symmetry.	

	
15	
He	then	introduces	polar	coordinates	and	designates	a	fourth	variable	by	the	
letter	l:	
	

	

Fig.	20	–	Hilbert	opts	for	polar	coordinates.	

	
There	are	several	things	to	note	in	this	excerpt	of	fig.	20.	We	can	read	in	the	
underlined	passage	of	hypothesis	#3:		
We	find	again	the	theme	of	a	solution	with	a	central	symmetry,	and	not	a	
spherical	symmetry.	
In	equation	(42)	he	presents	the	bilinear	form	of	his	metric,	and	then	
	where	this	variable	 r*	quickly	
introduces	the	hypothesis	   r * = G(r)
transforms	into	r.	The	translation	is:	

"The  gravitation  is  centrally  symmetric  with  respect  to  the 
origin of coordinates." 

"If we introduce r* in (42) instead of r and then eliminate the 
sign *, the result is the expression (43)." 

	
16	
This	hypothesis	will	then	totally	guide	his	solution.	Incidentally,	Hilbert	
indicates	the	nature	of	his	temporal	coordinate	l:		
	

	

"then for l = i t (43) results in the desired metric in the form first 
found by Schwarzschild." 

Fig.	21	–	Hilbert's	pure	imaginary	time	and	his	formulation	of	the	solution.	
	For	Hilbert,	spacetime	is	a	fiber	bundle,	built	from	a	real	space	(	x	,	y	,	z	)	but	
the	fiber,	i.e.	the	fourth	coordinate	l,	is	purely	imaginary.		
Regarding	Schwarzschild's	solution,	this	passage	is	absolutely	crucial	and	
will	guide	a	century	of	scientific	work.	Hilbert	makes	a	confusion	when	he	
writes:		
If	his	solution	is	completed	(45)	it	should	be	written:		
+ r 2dϑ2 + r 2sin2ϑdϕ2	
whereas	the	real	Schwarzschild	solution	is:		
R 3= (r 3+α3 )1/3	
The	difference	is	obvious.	Hilbert	confused	his	coordinate	r	with	the	auxiliary	
variable	R	introduced	by	Schwarzschild.	He	also	chooses	a	reverse	signature.		
In	the	rest	of	the	paper,	Hilbert	comes	back	to	this	choice	of	variable	in	a	
footnote,	considering	it	merely	pointless.	He	sees	it	only	as	a	wish	to	reject	
the	singularity	back	to	the	origin.

does, is not to be recommended in my opinion; 
Schwarzschild’s transformation is moreover not the simplest 
that achieves this goal."

Translation:		
"To transform the locations to the origin, as Schwarzschild 
	Hilbert	considers	that	what	happens	at	this	Schwarzschild	sphere	is	a	true	
singularity,	whereas	it	will	be	classically	shown	afterward	that	it	is	only	a	
coordinate	singularity,	that	can	be	cancelled	out	with	an	appropriate	change	
of	variable.		
	
Geometry	signification	
The	solution	to	Einstein's	equation	is	a	four-dimensional	hypersurface.	
Einstein,	Schwarzschild,	Frank,	Droste,	and	Weyl	relied	on	the	idea	that	the	
element	of	length	s,	hence	the	proper	time,	the	only	thing	independent	of	the	
choice	of	coordinates	on	this	hypersurface,	is	a	real	quantity.		
Let's	go	back	to	Schwarzschild's	1916	solution.	Schwarzschild	does	not	make	
it	explicit,	simply	because	he	does	not	see	the	point	in	it.	He	merely	wants	to	
show	the	same	result	as	Einstein's	explanation	of	the	precession	of	the	
perihelion	of	Mercury.	No	one	at	this	time	thinks	astronomical	objects	
requiring	a	nonlinear	treatment	of	the	problem	could	really	exist.	His	
quantity	α	is	nothing	but	what	will	later	be	called	the	Schwarzschild	radius	Rs.	
He	immediately	notices	that	for	the	Sun,	it	is	equivalent	to	one	hundred	
thousandth	of	its	diameter.	As	it	happens,	in	his	second	paper	publish	in	
February	1916	[8]	which	we	will	come	back	to,	he	built	a	geometry	within	a	
sphere	filled	with	a	fluid	of	constant	density,	a	non-singular	solution,	so	he

does	not	find	relevant	to	deal	in	his	first	"exterior	solution"	paper	with	a	
region	of	space	that	is	related	to	the	"interior	solution".	
In	2011,	Christian	Corda	[13]	makes	this	solution	explicit:	
	
Keep	in	mind	that	such	a	metric	can	be	expressed	in	any	arbitrary	coordinate	
system.	These	coordinates	are	then	merely	numbers,	space	markers.	The	only	
size	having	an	intrinsic	property	is	the	length	s.	Then,	all	boils	down	to	the	
choice	for	this	length.	
If	we	decide	that	this	length	s	is	real,	then	such	an	expression	designates	a	
4D	hypersurface.	The	choice	of	angles	 θ	and	 φ	implies	a	solution	with	a	
spherical	symmetry	(instead	of	a	central	one).	Helical	geodesics	exist	on	this	
hypersurface,	that	can	be	expressed	giving	a	fixed	value	to	θ,	and	fixing	the	
coordinate	r.	The	variables	t	and	φ	linearly	depend	on	the	parameter	s.	Thus,	
they	are	both	related	by	a	linear	function.	Spatial	projection	of	such	geodesic	
can	be	calculated:	they	simply	become	circles.	
It	is	therefore	possible	to	travel	along	this	hypersurface,	drawing	parallel	
circles.	If	their	perimeter	can	reach	+∞	it	is	however	limited	to	less	than	2πα.	
If	the	value	of	the	angle	q is	varied	then	this	family	of	parallel	circles	
generates	a	family	of	parallel	spheres.	Let	us	note	that	we	deliberately	use	
the	word	"parallel"	and	not	"concentric"	because	the	Schwarzschild	solution	
has	a	spherical	symmetry	and	not,	as	written	by	Hilbert,	a	central	one.	
As	we	skim	through	this	series	of	parallel	spheres,	by	reducing	their	area,	at	
some	point	a	minimal	value	is	reached	(if	we	decide	that	the	hypersurface	is	
real).	This	situation	is	met:	
• Either	for	the	value	 R	=	 α	in	the	case	of	what	we	call	"Hilbert's	
representation"	   ( t , R ,θ,ϕ)	(introducing	the	auxiliary	quantity	 R	
according	to	Schwarzschild).	
• Or	for	the	value	r	=	0	in	Schwarzschild's	representation	  ( t , R ,θ,ϕ).	
This	hypersurface	is	thus	uncontractible.	How	to	interpret	it?		
One	can	of	course	decide	it	is	a	manifold	with	boundary.	A	boundary,	
incidentally,	along	which	the	determinant	of	the	metric	is	zero	in	
Schwarzschild's	representation.	This	will	be	discussed	in	the	second	part	of	
this	article.	But	in	the	1960s,	other	paths	were	considered.		

	

Extensions	of	the	solution	and	their	meaning	

	
19	
Decades	after	the	emergence	of	the	Schwarzschild	solution,	it	is	known	only	
through	subsequent	comments	published	afterward.	I	was	very	surprised	at	
a	recent	international	conference	on	black	holes2	held	in	Frankfurt	
(Schwarzschild's	birthplace),	specifically	entitled	"The	Karl	Schwarzschild	
Meeting",	that	no	attendee,	including	German	natives,	had	never	read	the	
founding	papers	I	have	just	mentioned,	as	if	the	origin	of	the	model	were	lost	
in	the	mists	of	the	past.	In	his	masterly	lecture	in	front	of	all	the	delegates,	
Juan	Maldacena	said:3	

Why	do	astrophysicists	refer	to	the	Schwarzschild	solution?	

—		The	Schwarzschild	solution	has	confused	us	over	a	hundred	years	and	it	has	
forced	us	to	sharpen	our	views	on	space	and	time.	It	has	led	to	a	sharper	
understanding	of	Einstein’s	theory.	Experimentally,	it	is	explaining	several	
astrophysical	 observations.	 Its	 quantum	 aspects	 have	 been	 a	 source	 of	
theoretical	paradoxes	that	are	forcing	us	to	understand	better	the	relation	
between	spacetime,	geometry	and	quantum	mechanics.	

	This	text	suggests	that	the	immediate	understanding	of	the	Schwarzschild	
solution	remained	limited	for	a	while,	but	thanks	to	further	studies,	a	century	
of	work	made	it	possible	to	improve	this	reading	by	introducing	an	extended	
view	of	spacetime.		
	
As	will	be	discussed	in	the	second	part	of	this	article,	Schwarzschild	had	
completed	in	February	1916	his	first	"exterior	solution"	[7]	with	a	second	
"interior	solution"	[8]	related	to	the	geometry	within	a	sphere	filled	by	a	fluid	
of	constant	density.	At	this	point,	the	geometry	describing	a	star	immersed	
in	a	vacuum	was	completely	achieved.		
But	progress	in	observations	would	reveal	a	new	problem.	In	our	galaxy,	half	
of	the	stellar	systems	are	multiple	star	systems.	So	there	should	exist	a	quite	
large	number	of	binaries	where	one	of	the	two	stars	became	a	subcritical	
neutron	star,	that	could	still	be	described	with	the	two	exterior	and	interior	
Schwarzschild	metrics.	Its	companion	star	is	then	called	the	 donor,	as	it

continues	to	emit	stellar	wind	that	is	gravitationally	captured	by	its	small	
companion,	named	the	accretor.		
In	his	first	paper,	evaluating	the	critical	radius	  (α= Rs = 2m)	and	relating	it	to	
the	mass	responsible	for	this	geometry,	he	had	concluded	that	beyond	a	
certain	value,	this	"Schwarzschild	radius"	could	exceed	the	star	radius.		
This	is	the	question	asked	by	observers	to	theoreticians:		
—  Assuming	 that	 a	 supernova	 only	 left	 a	 subcritical	 neutron	 star	 after	 its	
A	question	impossible	to	avoid.	Theoreticians	therefore	imagined	that	the	
exterior	Schwarzschild	solution,	yet	referring	to	a	portion	of	an	empty	space,	
could	describe	a	new	state	of	matter,	popularized	by	the	name	"black	hole".		
	
What	is	the	current	presentation	of	this	Schwarzschild	solution?	Take	for	
example	the	book	of	Adler,	Bazin	and	Schiffer.	[14]	Page	187,	equations	(6.4)	
and	(6.5)	the	authors	reiterate	Hilbert's	hypothesis,	writing:	
ˆr = C(r) r	
A	few	lines	later,	the	solution	was	again	particularized,	see	equation	(6.9):	
Quelques	lignes	plus	loin,	la	solution	a	de	nouveau	été	particularisée,	voir	
l’équation	(6.9):	
Unless	the	functions	  ν(r)	and	  λ(r)	have	the	possibility	to	be	imaginary,	the	
impression	is	this	writing	militates	for	a	signature	 ( + − − − ).	In	this	realistic	
view,	the	metric	refers	to	a	hypersurface	where	the	only	relevant	variable,	
independent	of	the	choice	of	coordinates,	is	the	quantity	s.	This	is	the	proper	
time,	lived	by	any	test	particle.	For	a	distant	observer	however,	this	proper	
time	is	identified	to	the	variable	t.	Thus,	we	conclude	that	the	coordinate	time	
t	is	the	one	experienced	by	the	distant	observer.	The	following	figure	is	found	
in	every	book	about	general	relativity.	It	compares	the	free	fall	time	
measured	either	by	the	clock	tied	to	a	test	particle	falling	towards	the	
Schwarzschild	sphere,	or	the	one	of	a	distant	observer.		

  ds2 = eν(r )c 2dt 2 − eλ(r )dr 2 − r 2 ( dθ2 + sin 2θdϕ2 )	

  ds2 = Ac 2dt 2 − B dr 2 − C ( dθ2 + sin 2θdϕ2 )

in	terms	of	coordinate	time	t	and	proper	time	on	the	test	particle	s/c.	
	Thus,	whatever	the	phenomenon	witnessed	by	the	observer,	it	is	supposed	
to	unfold	before	his	eyes	during	an	infinite	amount	of	time,	which	allows	the	
theoretician	to	add:	
—  I	do	not	feel	bound	to	describe	the	result	of	a	process	which,	to	my	eyes,	
	In	passing,	the	New	Zealand	mathematician	Roy	Kerr	[15]	extended	this	type	
of	solution	to	a	"rotating	black	hole"	thanks	to	a	metric	with	a	less	
constraining	symmetry.	The	surface	that	has	been	called	the	"event	horizon"	
takes	the	topology	of	a	torus.	But	the	frozen	time,	this	freeze-frame,	is	also	
present	in	this	model.		
In	1960,	Joseph	Kruskal	[16]	and	George	Szekeres	[17]	constructed	a	first	
analytic	extension,	which	Maldacena	described	as	"extending	the	solution	to	
cover	the	full	spacetime".	
We	shall	also	cite	Corda,	who	implements	another	analytic	extension	of	the	
solution.	[13]	
In	1989,	Canadian	physicist	Leonard	S.	Abrams	published	a	paper	[18]	on	the	
Schwarzschild	solution	entitled	"Black	Holes:	The	Legacy	of	Hilbert's	Error"	
pointing	out	the	same	problems	as	those	mentioned	above.	Questions	also	
taken	up	by	Italian	physicist	Salvatore	Antoci.	[19]	[20]	Those	articles	had	
practically	no	echo	within	the	scientific	community,	except	for	a	text

coordinate	r	to	go	negative.	

	
22	
positioned	in	a	blog 4	by	a	mathematician	and	computer	scientist,	
W.	D.	Clinger,	presenting	himself	as	a	topology	specialist.	He	resumes	the	
arguments	of	Abrams,	writing:		
—  The	paper	is	well-written,	and	its	math	is	almost	(but	not	quite)	correct.		
A	little	further	on,	his	criticism	gets	stronger:	 "Where	 Abrams	 went	 badly	
wrong."	He	then	provides	the	correct	way	to	proceed:		
—  In	reality,	the	"quasiregular	singularity"	at	the	central	point	mass	of	the

values	of	  r =
For	that	matter	he	quotes	Corda,	who	does	the	same	and	constructs	a	
description	of	the	gravitational	collapse	of	the	neutron	star	which	ends	at	a	
negative	value	  r = −α= − Rs < 0.	
To	the	extent	that	these	authors	grant	themselves	the	freedom	to	extend	
spacetime	to	an	imaginary	portion,	this	can	no	longer	be	criticized.	On	the	
other	hand,	these	people	call	"crackpots"	anyone	who	does	not	feel	satisfied	
with	such	a	formula.		
	
In	1916,	Einstein	then	Schwarzschild	developed	solutions	to	the	field	
equation,	the	first	through	linearization	and	the	second	nonlinearly,	which	
refer	to	real	values	of	the	coordinates	and	to	a	real	value	of	the	length	s,	
measured	on	the	four-dimensional	hypersurface	using	the	metric.	This	work	
is	then	taken	up	by	different	authors,	like	Frank,	Droste,	Weyl,	always	with	
the	same	perspective.	This	approach	implies	the	constancy	of	an	explicit	
metric	signature	 ( + − − − ).		
On	this	panorama	comes	the	interpretation	given	by	the	mathematician	
David	Hilbert,	who	starts	from	a	different	vision	where	time,	and	proper	time,	
are	presented	as	pure	imaginary	quantities,	as	opposed	to	real	space	
coordinates,	which	goes	hand	in	hand	with	a	choice	of	metric	signature	
 ( − + + + )	and	explains	the	hyperbolic	property	of	this	solution.

Conclusion		

	
23	
When	half	a	century	later,	astrophysicists	are	asked	to	provide	a	model	able	
to	describe	a	destabilized	neutron	star,	they	opt	for	the	solution	found	by	
Hilbert,	deciding	to	extend	it,	via	analytic	continuation,	to	an	imaginary	
portion	of	spacetime,	where	the	element	of	length	becomes	purely	imaginary	
and	where	the	signature	of	the	metric	is	inverted.	The	goal	is	not	to	stop	at	
the	surface	of	the	Schwarzschild	sphere,	and	to	be	able	to	carry	their	
investigations	towards	the	"interior	of	the	object".	
It	all	depends	on	what	is	considered	to	fall	within	the	scope	of	physics	or	not.	
In	the	second	part	of	this	paper,	we	will	present	a	different	scenario,	in	which	
all	quantities	remain	real	and,	as	a	corollary,	the	metric	keeps	a	signature	
 ( + − − − ).
