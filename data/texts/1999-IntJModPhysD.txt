An attempt is made here to extend to the microscopic domain the scale invariant char-
acter of gravitation | which amounts to consider expansion as applying to any physical
scale. Surprisingly, this hypothesis does not prevent the redshift from being obtained.
It leads to strong restrictions concerning the choice between the presently available cos-
mological models and to new considerations about the notion of time. Moreover, there
is no horizon problem and resorting to inﬂation is not necessary.

1. Introduction

Since Hubble’s discovery of the recession of galaxies, obtaining the variation with
cosmic time of the scale parameter (or \radius") R(t) which describes the expansion
of the universe is the basic problem a cosmological theory has to deal with. The
closely related question of deciding relative to what the expansion takes place, or
where it stops, is much more seldom explicitly stated.1 It is commonly admitted
there is no expansion at distances smaller than the size of clusters of galaxies, so
that this size, or the size of our galaxy, or of the solar system, : : : can be used
as a reference scale. This may seem to be sensible at present, but what about the
past, when R(t) was smaller than these objects? The existence and observability of
permanent reference scales for time and length intervals thus appear to be assumed.
It is also commonly admitted | but this argument has been questioned2;3 | that
the scale parameter cannot be applied to all length scales in the universe, on the
grounds that this would amount to getting no expansion at all, so that the universe
would be scale invariant and there would be no redshift. On the other hand, if the
inﬂation theory eliminates the causality problem for the presently observed regions

of the universe, it does not in the future : : : : In order to solve these problems,
L. Nottale1 introduces a transition from scale independence to scale dependence in
the general frame of a theory of scale relativity.

Already Laplace1;4 had already pointed out the scale invariance of Newton’s
theory of gravitation, concluding that \the universe reduced to the smallest imag-
inable space would always present the same appearance to observers" and that
\the laws of nature only permit us to observe relative dimensions." Poincar(cid:19)e made
similar observations as concerns comparing time intervals as well as lengths at two
di(cid:11)erent instants (and this is, of course, the only way to proceed for time intervals):
he notes \we have no direct intuition of the equality of two lapses of time" | for
instance those \between noon and one o’clock and between two and three o’clock."5
So it should be possible to allow a general variation of all lengths2 and time inter-
vals as long as one keeps in mind that this kind of variation cannot be physically
observed by comparisons necessarily performed at the same instant: there would be
no permanent observable reference scale; since this looks as an unnecessary compli-
cation, the possibility for expansion to act at any scale has seldom been considered
seriously. However, Hoyle and Narlikar,6 as an alternative to expansion, used a
somewhat similar view in their variable mass theory, where all masses are supposed
to increase with cosmic time, which implies decreasing wavelengths for atomic radi-
ations and decreasing sizes for atoms. Indeed, it may be observed that, as opposed
to the case of pure gravitation, where the size and period of a Keplerian orbit can
be changed arbitrarily as long as Kepler’s laws are respected, without any modi-
(cid:12)cation of Newton’s constant nor of the masses of the bodies, physical constants
must be allowed to change if the expansion is considered to apply, for instance, to
structures the size of which is directly linked to atomic sizes. This is clear from the
expression of the Bohr radius,

a0 =

h2(cid:15)0
(cid:25)mee2 =

~

;

me(cid:11)c

(1)

which involves physical constants only: supposing the absence of permanent observ-
able reference scales for length and time intervals implies some physical constants,
among which c, can vary with cosmic time.

So, since c also appears in the expression of the metric tensor, we shall suppose
it to be variable and we shall look for a function R(t) which resulted from one of the
classical cosmological theories: such a function should not depend on hypotheses
which can be made about the reference scale relative to which R(t) is de(cid:12)ned. This
leads to a highly constrained problem which cannot be solved realistically (i.e., with
nonzero pressure and density) unless more than four dimensions are introduced
in the description of spacetime. This idea, initially due to Einstein and recently
reintroduced by P. Wesson and his co-workers,7;8 aims at obtaining the properties
of matter in our four-dimensional spacetime in a purely geometrical way, starting
from Einstein’s equations

R(cid:22)(cid:23) = 0

where T(cid:22)(cid:23) is the energy{momentum tensor of a perfect ﬂuid, and we shall try it
together with the hypothesis of a variable c.

2. The Einstein Equations

We write Einstein’s equations for an arbitrary number n of space dimensions and
with a variable c in a maximally symmetric space, hence with a metric which,
as concerns space, generalizes to n dimensions the metric of Robertson{Walker.
Choosing such a metric with n greater than 3 is obviously surprising | usually a
di(cid:11)erent scale factor is associated with space dimensions beyond the third one |
and this will be discussed later in Secs. 5 and 6.

It is to be noted that, as a consequence of our hypotheses, the geometrical
spacetime coordinates | de(cid:12)ned with respect to permanent reference scales |
will appear to be distinct from the physically observable ones. This is obvious for
lengths: expansion applying to spatial domains of arbitrary size, physical distances
here are the comobile ones; the case of time intervals will be dealt with in Secs. 3
and 4. So as to make this distinction easier, geometrical coordinates or intervals will
generally be written using Latin characters, and physical coordinates or intervals
using Greek ones.

Designing by 0 the index corresponding to the chronological coordinate x0,
with dx0 = c(t)dt, and by i, j = 1; 2; : : : ; n the indices associated with the spatial
coordinates, the components of the metric tensor are

g00 = −1 ;
gi0 = 0 ;

gij = R2(t)~gij ;

~gij = 0 (i 6= j) ;

where the ~gij depend on the space coordinates only. Choosing x0 rather than t and
taking into account the time-dependence of c at the end of the calculations allow
one to get a constant g00 and thus a smaller number of nonzero components for the
a(cid:14)ne connection. Starting from

Γ(cid:12)

γ(cid:11) =

3. Time and the Redshift

In the same way as lengths remain proportional to the cosmological scale factor
R(t), intervals of cosmic time vary as t itself: for instance, the period T = l=c of a
radiation of wavelength l varies as
T (cid:25) R

γ (cid:25) t

(cid:25) R

(50)

γ+1

c

and the same kind of variation will characterize the period of any circular motion,
−1=γ, as also
since its speed can be de(cid:12)ned as a fraction of c, and thus varies as R
results for various examples (period of a pendulum, of planetary motions; : : :) from
the gauge relations described in Sec. 7: every time interval expands proportionally
to cosmic time with respect to a permanent reference scale.

At a given t, a cosmic time interval dt can but be de(cid:12)ned as proportional to t
and to the number d# of periods a reference clock completes during this interval dt

dt = ktd# ;

(51)

where k is a constant, the dimension of which should be the inverse of a time if #
is to be a time also. Obviously, intervals of # only (and of the associated proper
time), not of t, can be measured.

Let us now state the nature of # more precisely. The square of the (1 + 3)
spacetime interval with zero space curvature writes, following from now on the
timelike convention

where dl is the space interval, or, introducing R(t), which we suppose to have the
dimension of a length

and here d(cid:24) stands for the spatial distance in dimensionless comoving coordinates.

Computing c(t) (with (cid:15) = 1) from (21) and (47)

ds2 = c2(t)dt2 − dl2 ;

ds2 = c2(t)dt2 − R2(t)d(cid:24)2

d(cid:21) = RM d(cid:24)

to give the spatial distance d(cid:21) the dimension of a length. Thus # can be identi(cid:12)ed
with the conformal time, which gives the Robertson{Walker metric an expression
of the conformal type, and cM can be interpreted as the constant light velocity in
the Minkowski spacetime which is measured when using coordinates # and (cid:21). It
may be noted that, up to a scaling factor, a unique de(cid:12)nition of the conformal time
is obtained here for the dust universe as well as the for the radiation one | which
does not happen in the classical theory.

So as to study the formation of the redshift, let us consider, as in Ref. 10,
two events occurring at the same point in space and separated by a time interval
corresponding to (56)

(cid:1)s1 = cM a(t1)(cid:1)# ;

(58)

where this time interval is small as compared to time t1. If these two events consist
in the emission of two light signals which will be perceived at another point in space,
the time interval between the two instants of reception will be the same in conformal
time as in (58), that is, (cid:1)#. This results directly from (56): light propagation is
described by

so that, for a propagation along the radial coordinate (cid:31),

# = (cid:6) RM
cM

(cid:31) + C ;

(62)
where C is constant: the conformal time needed to go from the emission point to
the reception one depends on the di(cid:11)erence of the radial coordinates of these points
only and not on the instant of emission, so both signals will arrive at the (same)
reception point at two instants separated by the same conformal time interval (cid:1)#
as at their emission. To this (cid:1)# corresponds at the reception time t2 an interval

between (cid:1)(cid:28)2 and the emission period (cid:1)(cid:28)e2 of the same radiation at the reception
place at t2 and, as results from (50),

so that

there would be no redshift if cosmic time intervals were accessible to measurement.
In the present model they are not, and the redshift is obtained with conformal
time intervals (68). This is a logical consequence of the absence of an observable

permanent reference scale for time: t can be regarded as a purely geometrical vari-
able which might be measured from outside the universe, but not inside it (and, by
de(cid:12)nition, there is no outside). The same can be said about the associated space
variables l, and the actual physical variables are # and (cid:21), physical time being the
proper time associated with coordinate time # through

d(cid:28)# = a(t)d# :

(74)

Of course, at a given t, intervals (cid:1)# of conformal time only can be measured. As
concerns cosmic time and space variables, only relations established without using
nonmeasurable quantities (such as in (72)) are physically meaningful. For example,
horizon calculations can be performed with either type of variables:

(a) in geometrical coordinates, they involve ratios of quantities taken at the same

time only, the event and the particle horizons being de(cid:12)ned at time t1 as

A cosmic time interval can be de(cid:12)ned as an ordered pair (t1; t2) to be associated

with the ratio t2=t1 (or even R(t2)=R(t1)) | as in (71) for instance

This de(cid:12)nes on cosmic time intervals a multiplicative group law

(cid:30)(t1; t2) =

t2
t1

:

(cid:30)(t0; t2) = (cid:30)(t0; t1)(cid:30)(t1; t2)

isomorphic to the additive one speci(cid:12)ed by (78) and (81). And indeed, a theorem
from group theory states that every one | parameter connected di(cid:11)erentiable group
is isomorphic to an additive one and that the additive parameter is unique:11;12 so
# only is additive, and it can be identi(cid:12)ed with the linear time (cid:18) introduced by
Misner13 as

(cid:18) (cid:24) ln

R(t)
R(t0)

:

Thus, the three possible time notions (cosmic, conformal and linear) of L(cid:19)evy-
Leblond11 reduce here to two ones only. As already seen, one of them (conformal
time #) can be measured and thus appears to coincide with physical time, whereas,
by the lack of observability of its reference scale, cosmic time t cannot. However in
(50) and (51), t shows up as the dilation parameter of intervals of cosmic time, in
the same way as R(t) is the dilation parameter of intervals of length, so that not
only space, but spacetime itself, is in expansion. It may be noted that this interpre-
tation of t already seems to be possible for Kepler’s third law: if the larger axis of
an orbit is multiplied by a factor R, the period must be multiplied by a factor t such
that t2=R3 is constant, hence the possibility of interpreting the relation R (cid:24) t2=3
as a relation between the scale parameters for space and time dimensions. Indeed,
the third law expresses the invariance of Kepler’s problem in the inhomogeneous
dilation generated by the in(cid:12)nitesimal operator

(85)

(see Ref. 14).

One notion of time only being classically used in physics, it seems interesting to
approximate the relation between # and t by a linear function, i.e., to replace the
function #(t) by its tangent in the neighbourhood of an instant t, thus shifting from
t to # through a change of scale and origin which does not modify the equations of
physics.

Substituting t1 + (cid:1)t for t in (78), one gets

a result which is valid for t in the vicinity of t1 and which gives, when extended to
larger values of t, the same variation of R with cosmic time as in inﬂation theory

As a last remark, the relation between cosmic and conformal times might help
understand | if this is con(cid:12)rmed | why the oldest stars seem to be older than

on the main sequence by the amount of energy used per time unit, and of course is
computed as a conformal time interval. The relation between this interval and the
cosmic times tM and t0 which respectively represent the age of the universe and
the time the star entered the main sequence is given by (95) for a star which leaves

5. Euclidian Subspaces in a Constant Negative Curvature

Manifold

A well-known example of such a situation is that of 3-space in the spacetime of
steady-state cosmology.9 Schr¨odinger,16 who remarked that curvature depends on
the frame, had already studied such a case as the Lema^(cid:16)tre{Robertson frame of the
de Sitter universe, represented as a one-shell hyperboloid H1

x2 + u2 + v2 + y2 − z2 = R2

embedded in a (cid:12)ve-dimensional space with a (1; 4) Lorentzian metric

d(cid:27)2 = −dx2 − du2 − dv2 − dy2 + dz2 :

What we need here | so as to have a negative curvature space and not spacetime

| is a two-shell hyperboloid H2

x2 + u2 + v2 + y2 − z2 = −R2

embedded in the same Lorentz space, with the di(cid:11)erence that this imbedding space
is completely (cid:12)ctitious here, so that, in particular, no coordinate system in it has
to be interpreted as including time as one of its components.

The Lema^(cid:16)tre transformation leading to Euclidean subspaces of H1 reads

With these new variables, the d(cid:27)2 in (99) becomes

d(cid:27)2 = − exp(2(cid:22)(cid:18))(d(cid:22)x2 + d(cid:22)u2 + d(cid:22)v2) + R2d(cid:22)(cid:18)2

as can be shown using the following relations deduced from (101){(104)

x = (cid:22)x exp((cid:22)(cid:18)) ;

v = (cid:22)v exp((cid:22)(cid:18)) ;

u = (cid:22)u exp((cid:22)(cid:18)) ;
y + z = R exp((cid:22)(cid:18)) ;

and

where

and y − z has been computed from
y − z =

R2 − x2 − u2 − v2

:

y + z

It is clear from (105) that the subspaces ((cid:22)x; (cid:22)u; (cid:22)v) are Euclidean.

The same Lema^(cid:16)tre transformation leads to Euclidean subspaces of H2 with the

only di(cid:11)erences that now

−R2 − x2 − u2 − v2

y − z =

y + z

= −R exp(−(cid:22)(cid:18)) − (cid:22)r2

R exp((cid:22)(cid:18))

d(cid:27)2 = − exp(2(cid:22)(cid:18))(d(cid:22)x2 + d(cid:22)u2 + d(cid:22)v2) − R2d(cid:22)(cid:18)2 :

The Euclidean subspaces ((cid:22)x; (cid:22)u; (cid:22)v) of H1 and H2 are the three-dimensional gener-
alizations of the parabolae traced on their restrictions to the dimensions (x; y; z)
by planes y + z = C, a constant, and it may be noted (as concerns H2) that when
R varies with time (expansion), (cid:22)(cid:18) remains constant, so that these subspaces are
preserved.
Now, depending on the value of C, there is an in(cid:12)nity of such subspaces and it
seems to be logical, so as to keep (as supposed from the beginning) a zero four-
dimensional density, to associate to each subspace with density (cid:26) another one with
negative density −(cid:26) in a twofold structure with

(cid:26) > 0 ;

G > 0 on the 1st sheet

(cid:26) < 0 ;

G < 0

on the 2nd sheet

both of which possibilities being allowed as solutions of (43) (it may be noted
that (cid:26)G also, and not G alone, appears in the Einstein equations). (cid:26) is an active
gravitational mass density, so that two masses should attract when in the same
sheet and repel when not if one keeps on identifying passive gravitational mass
and inertial mass. Such a negative density sheet has already been proposed as a
candidate for dark matter in (cid:12)rst simulations of the large scale structure of the
universe.17;18

6. The Case of Non-Euclidean Subspaces
Such subspaces obviously exist (for k = −1, take for instance y2 constant in (100)
and for k = 1, z2 constant and larger than R2). However, supposing k = −1 in
steps (24){(30) implies a zero density (hence the necessity to take n > 3), and k = 1
yields γ = 1=2 and 1 for the radiation and the matter dominated eras respectively,
that is no correspondence with previous theories. Hence the Friedmann solution
with k = 0 is the only one which can be found following the present procedure.

7. Gauge Relations

Since, in geometrical coordinates, c has been assumed to vary with time, this should
be the same for other physical constants also. This implies gauge relations which
have been proposed in Refs. 19 and 20 for the case γ = 2 (Eq. (38)). Similar relations
can be obtained here, without a special treatment being required for Schr¨odinger’s
equation. Assuming every mass varies as M and the Bohr radius as R, as already
supposed, and using (38) yields for instance, if (cid:11) (which is dimensionless) remains
constant,

In the same way, starting from Newton’s formula for the two-body problem and
still using (38) gives for the Einstein constant

whatever the value of γ is. With no precision about the variance of masses, such
relations are purely kinematical | being derived from the variances of length and
time intervals. One more hypothesis has to be made to go further; for example, if
G=c2 is to be a constant, this implies

None of these variations can be detected in the laboratory since, as in the case
of length and time intervals, no permanent reference scale can be used for that. So,
in the physical world, constants are but constants, as light velocity cM in (56).

However, the above assumption about G=c2 is important: it allows the diver-
genceless character of the energy{momentum tensor to be kept in Einstein’s
). Moreover, substituting (47) into (41) yields for the energy density

8. Discussions and Conclusion

In order to express the hypothesis of nonobservability of permanent reference scales
for time and length intervals, we have assumed the scale parameter R(t) applies
to any scale in the universe | which implies the possibility of a variation with
cosmic time of the constants of physics. Thus a clear distinction is made between
the universe and the permanent scales with respect to which its time and space
charactistics (its age and scale parameter) are de(cid:12)ned, so that these permanent
scales are to be considered as external to the universe. As opposed to what can be
expected, this does not prevent the redshift from being obtained in the resulting
theory if one notes that cosmic time (and length) intervals | for which permanent
reference scales have to exist as soon as one writes down expressions (3){(5) or
(52) for the metric | are no longer measurable quantities. The physical quantities,
measurable from inside the universe, are from this viewpoint the proper time and
the proper distances associated with conformal time # and comobile coordinates

(cid:21) in Eq. (56) (as # only, and its associated proper time, can be measured, one
may wonder why not drop t: however, no permanent reference scale is supposed to
exist for #, and if time is to be geometrized, it seems it should be endowed with
this property). Thus time and space are dealt with in the same way, as contrasts
with the classical theory: as well as space, cosmic time expands, and a time arrow
arises naturally. The cosmological and the gravitational redshifts both originate in
the variations of the g00 coe(cid:14)cient of the metric, the former with time, the latter
with position in space | although in both cases, the shift owes its existence in
the phenomenon (the emission of a radiation) being produced and observed as two
distant events in spacetime.
In physical (i.e., conformal) time, the origin of the universe is shifted to −1,
corroborating the ideas developed by L(cid:19)evy-Leblond and Misner in Refs. 11 and
13, and this is linked with the logarithmic dependence of # on t as results from
(51). This removes the question of knowing what existed before the big bang and
might help to solve the problem raised by the age of the oldest star clusters. Other
interesting aspects of the model are the absence of horizons and the fact it yields
the Euclidean character of one of the Friedmann models, in full agreement with
many observations.

As regards the interpretation, the fact that intervals of # and (cid:21) only are phys-
ically measurable implies the impossibility of directly observing any expansion |
hence there is no problem about where it stops; however the metric (56) is not
stationary, hence the redshift. Concerning the matter-dominated era, only experi-
ments can help to decide whether scale invariance holds: structures such as atoms
or galaxies may well withstand expansion owing to their internal forces; as for the
radiation era, the absence of horizons is an interesting characteristic which may
supply possibilities for an alternative to the scalar (cid:12)eld which is evoked to justify
inﬂation at the microscopic level.

Interestingly, as resulted from the resolution of the system | (29) and (30), the
density corresponds to the curvature of n-space; the derivative of c with respect to
cosmic time appears in the pressure term only.

The possibility of an objection to the model might be found in the identi(cid:12)cation
of terms involving a variable c with the energy{matter terms of another one (the
Friedmann model) which does not suppose this variation. In fact, it may be noted

which can also be derived from (29) and (30) above: they involve G=c2 only when
expressed in terms of the density of energy ". With G=c2 constant as indicated
above, there is no contradiction in identifying the classical terms with those of the
present model.

As a last remark, it may be noted that the basic hypotheses we have started
from involve both general relativity and, through the expression of the Bohr radius,
a fundamental result of quantum mechanics | which are both, at an elementary
level, connected with an inverse square law.
