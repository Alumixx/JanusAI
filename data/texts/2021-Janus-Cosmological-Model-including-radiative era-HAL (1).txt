Abstract	:		
If	one	tries	to	include	negative	masses	in	General	Relativity	one	immediately	comes	up	
against	the	runaway	effect,	violating	the	principle	of	action-reaction.	It	is	then	necessary	
to	consider	a	bimetric	model.	The	starting	point	is	S.	Hossenfelder's	model,	which	is	
mathematically	correct,	but	incompatible	with	the	observational	data.	This	approach	is	
taken	up	again.	The	field	equations	then	make	it	possible	to	account	for	many	
observational	aspects,	including	the	acceleration	of	expansion,	the	strong	gravitational	
lens	effects	in	the	vicinity	of	galaxies	and	clusters,	and	the	flatness	of	the	rotation	curves.	
Using	the	dynamic	group	theory	we	show	that	this	negative	mass	is	a	copy	of	classical	
antimatter,	with	negative	mass.	This	approach,	concretizing	the	ideas	of	A.Sakharov,	
resolves	the	paradox	of	the	absence	of	observation	of	primordial	antimatter.	The	
questions	remaining	to	be	addressed	are	listed	so	that	the	model	could	pretend	to	be		a	
challenger	to	the	mainstream	ΛCDM	model.

	1	–	Cosmology	today.	Questions	that	remain	unsolved.	
Fifty	years	ago	the	scientific	community	thought	it	had	built	a	model	with	a	high	level	of	
credibility,	based	on	Einstein's	field	equation.	At	that	time	the	debate	among	specialists	
centered	on	the	choice	between	one	of	Friedmann's	three	models	and	everyone	thought	
that	the	cosmological	constant	was	either	null	or	negligible.	
It	all	began	with	the	problem	posed	by	the	advance	of	Mercury's	perihelion.	Leverrier's	
earlier	attempt	at	interpretation,	based	on	a	new	planet	he	had	called	Vulcan,	had	failed.	
Einstein	provided	the	solution	by	creating	a	major	paradigm	shift.		His	model	was	later	
supported	by	the	evidence	of	the	gravitational	lens	effect	that	the	Sun	had	on	the	light	
from	the	stars.

The	construction	of	unsteady	solutions	led	to	a	model	where	the	universe	was	
expanding	from	a	moment	zero.	Thus,	going	back	in	time,	one	must	deal	with	conditions	
of	temperature	and	pressure	beyond	imagination.	It	was	therefore	essential	to	describe	
the	cosmic	content	under	such	conditions.		
We	thus	envisaged	conditions	where	the	universe	was	in	a	state	of	equilibrium	where	
the	synthesis	of	pairs	of	particles	and	antiparticles	was	compensated	by	the	annihilation	
of	these	same	pairs	by	producing	photons.	Under	these	conditions	the	cooling	due	to	the	
expansion	stopped	this	production	of	pairs,	while	the	annihilation	reactions	continued.	
These	primordial	photons,	corresponding	to	a	background	radiation	at	2.7°,	were	
highlighted,	which	gave	a	strong	credibility	to	the	model.		
But	under	these	conditions	the	annihilation	of	the	matter-antimatter	pairs	should	have	
continued	until	their	complete	disappearance.	The	simple	fact	that	we	have	before	our	
eyes	a	universe	made	up	of	matter	showed	that	this	was	not	the	case.	A	question	then	
arose:		
-  What	had	become	of	this	primordial	antimatter,	of	which	all	attempts	to	bring	to	light	
proved	to	be	failures?			
	
	Currently,	and	we	insist	on	this	point	of	epistemology,	no	scientist	doubts	their	

existence	when	it	has	not	been	possible	to	detect	the	presence	of	these	particles	of	
primordial	antimatter	

1	-	We	will	bring	in	this	article	a	consistent	answer	to	this	problem,	including	the	
explanation	 of	 this	 non-observation	 of	 primordial	 antimatter	 and	 describing	
precisely	the	nature	of	its	components.	

Beyond	these	already	very	impressive	temperatures	it	was	desirable	to	be	able	to	
provide	again	a	description	of	the	cosmic	content.	Particle	accelerators	thus	became	the	
tools	to	try	to	re-create	these	conditions	in	the	laboratory.	Particle	physics	developed.	
Not	only	did	it	make	it	possible	to	recreate	this	synthesis	of	antimatter	in	situ,	but	it	
constituted	a	dismantling	of	the	constituents	of	the	nuclei	which	culminated	with	the	
quarks	model,	allowing	the	prediction	of	the	existence	of	new,	unstable	particles,	whose	
fleeting	presence	was	demonstrated	by	detailing	the	reaction	products.	It	was	then	that	
it	proved	impossible	to	obtain	direct	evidence	of	quarks,	although	they	are	equipped	
with	fractional	electric	charges.	This	question	was	resolved	by	assuming	that	these	
quarks	in	the	free	state,	undergoing	forces	of	attraction	increasing	with	distance,	could	
not	persist	for	their	existence	to	be	demonstrated.	Nevertheless,	given	the	fertility	of	the	
model,	with	respect	to	the	construction	of	new	particles,	whose	existence	was	proven,	it	
was	imposed.				
It	was	nevertheless	necessary	to	construct	a	description	of	the	cosmic	content	for	even	
higher	temperatures.	The	standard	particle	model	was	then	extended	by	creating	what	
was	called	supersymmetry.		
A	very	large	number	of	papers	were	then	published	in	high	level	journals,	bringing	the	
description	of	superparticles,	partners	of	the	standard	particles,	such	as	photino,	
neutralino	etc....			

But	today	scientists	cannot	agree	on	both	an	inflationary	scenario	and	a	precise	
inflaton	model.	

But	 while	 this	 movement	 gave	 rise,	 for	 decades,	 to	 the	 publication	 of	
innumerable	articles	in	very	high	level	journals,	it	proved	incapable	of	producing	

But	 while	 the	 energies	 used	 had	 largely	 reached	 and	 exceeded	 the	 required	
thresholds,	 the	 existence	 of	 any	 of	 these	 superparticles	 could	 not	 be	
demonstrated.	

a	model	of	anything	that	would	lend	itself	to	any	kind	of	observation.	

	
3	
For	decades,	many	scientists	tried	to	develop	a	theory	that	was	both	more	
comprehensive	and	totally	different	from	the	material	that	became	known	as	string	
theory.	
Other	problems	arose.	The	observations	made	with	the	help	of	satellites	showed	the	
extraordinary	homogeneity	of	the	primitive	universe,	in	its	radiative	phase.	The	journals	
published	a	very	large	number	of	articles	tending	to	explain	this	state	of	affairs	by	a	
fantastic	primordial	inflation,	due	to	a	mysterious	field	of	inflatons	
Other	problems	arose.	At	the	end	of	the	seventies,	the	measurement	of	the	rotational	
velocities	of	gaseous	elements	in	galaxies	became	precise	enough	to	create	a	new	
paradox:	the	flatness	of	these	curves	at	the	galactic	periphery	[1]	.	The	distribution	of	
matter	deduced	from	the	observations	did	not	allow	to	reconstruct	these	curves.	
The	scientific	community	then	saw	in	such	a	phenomenon	the	undeniable	proof	of	the	
existence	of	particles	with	mass,	undetected.	
-  By	reversing	the	problem	one	considered	that	instead	of	deducing	the	rotation	
background	noise	constituted	by	cosmic	rays,	or	in	space,	in	detectors	
2	–	In	this	paper	we	will	provide	an	alternative	interpretation	of	the	flatness	of	
to	reconstruct	them	accurately.	
This	problem	of	the	flatness	of	the	rotation	curves	was	joined	to	that	of	the	excessive	
velocities	of	galaxies	in	clusters,	exceeding	the	escape	velocity	calculated	on	the	mass	of	
such	clusters,	deduced	from	the	observations.	
Here	again	the	new	model,	implying	the	existence	of	a	dark	matter	of	unknown	nature,	
over	invoked	it	to	account	for	this	phenomenon	by	associating	to	the	clusters	a	vast	halo	
constituted	by	this	unidentified	component.	

-	To	date,	in	spite	of	the	very	large	means	implemented,	no	dark	matter	particles	
have	been	detected	in	experiments	conducted	underground,	sheltered	from	the	

curves	 of	 measurements	 on	 the	 local	 density	 of	 dark	 matter	 it	 was	 decided	 to		
deduce	it	from	the	shape	of	the	curves..

These	anomalies	concerning	the	rotation	velocities	in	galaxies	and	the	random	velocities	
of	galaxies	in	clusters	went	hand	in	hand	with	the	discovery	of	strong	gravitational	lens	
effects,	which	could	not	be	produced	by	the	masses	deduced	from	the	observations.		

While	 no	 direct	 observation	 or	 experiment	 (evidence	 of	 neutralino	 in	 particle	
accelerators)	 has	 so	 far	 succeeded	 in	 highlighting	 these	 components	 of	 dark	
matter,	the	scientific	community	considers	their	existence	as	an	established	fact,	
undeniable	insofar	as	their	presence	provides	both	the	means	to	constitute	these	
gravitational	lens	effects	in	the	vicinity	of	clusters	and	galaxies,	and	to	account	
for	the	kinematic	anomalies	found	in	the	vicinity	of	these	same	objects.		

4	 –	 In	 this	 paper	 we	 will	 provide	 an	 alternative	 interpretation	 of	 the	 strong	
gravitational	lens	effects	in	the	vicinity	of	galaxies	and	clusters.		

As	a	reminder,	we	will	mention	the	attempt	to	remotely	modify	Newton's	law,	proposed	
by	the	Israeli	Mordechaii	Milgrom	[2],	a	theory	devoid	of	ontological	(geometrical)	
foundation	that	fails	to	account	for	both	galaxy	and	cluster-related	effects.		
Another	important	problem	is	the	recent	discovery	of	the	phenomenon	of	the	
acceleration	of	cosmic	expansion,	sanctioned	in	2011	by	a	Nobel	Prize	([3],	[4],	[5]).	But	
here,	the	Einsteinian	model	could	provide	a	beginning	of	interpretation	by	reintroducing	
into	the	equation	the	cosmological	constant	Λ.	This	phenomenon	was	attributed	to	
negative	pressure.	The	pressure	being	a	density	of	energy	per	unit	volume,	this	same	
energy	was	itself	negative.		
These	different	aspects	were	placed	under	the	same	label,	that	of	a	dark	energy,	
associated	with	some	vacuum	energy,	which	quantum	mechanics	cannot	account	for.		
-  That	of	the	supposed	existence	of	a	cold	dark	matter	(animated	at	low	speeds	
-  That	of	the	existence	of	this	dark	energy,	phenomenologically	taken	into	account

provides	a	purely	phenomenological	reading	of	the	process.		

Indeed,	there	is	to	date	no	model	of	dark	energy,	and	no	beginning	of	explanation	
of	this	phenomenon	apart	from	the	phenomenology	associated	with	the	presence	
of	the	cosmological	constant,	synonymous	with	vacuum	energy.

lacunar	structure	of	the	observed	matter,	except	for	numerical	simulation	results,	
which	show	clusters	and	filaments.	

5	
7	–	In	this	article	we	give	the	reason	for	the	existence	of	such	a	lacunar	structure.		
Very	recently,	in	2017,	a	very	large	scale	mapping	of	the	universe	(a	cube	of	one	and	a	
half	billion	light	years	on	one	side,	giving	both	the	distribution	of	matter	(galaxies)	and	
the	general	shape	of	the	velocity	field	[7])	has	revealed	a	new	anomaly.	600	million	
light-years	from	our	galaxy,	the	existence	of	a	very	large	vacuum,	where	no	galaxy	was	
present,	was	revealed,	which,	given	the	direction	of	the	velocities	of	the	surrounding	
galaxies,	evoked	a	powerful	phenomenon	of	repulsion.	This	formation	was	given	the	
name	Great	Repeller.		

No	theoretical	modeling	of	this	phenomenon	has	been	published	in	a	high-level	
journal.	 At	 most,	 it	 has	 been	 suggested	 that	 the	 phenomenon	 could	 betray	 the	
presence	 of	 a	 gap	 in	 a	 uniform	 distribution	 of	 dark	 matter,	 which	 was	
tantamount	to	adding	another	hypothesis	to	a	first	hypothesis.	There	is	no	model	
describing	the	formation	of	such	a	gap.		

8	 –	 The	 model	 we	 propose	 provides	 an	 interpretation	 of	 this	 phenomenon,	

implying	the	existence	of	a	repulsive,	unobservable	cluster	of	negative	matter	at	
the	 center	 of	 this	 cell.	 This	 situation	 explains	 in	 passing	 the	 low	 magnitude	 of	
galaxies	with	strong	redshift,	considered	in	the	literature	as	dwarf	galaxies.		

		2	–	A	real	paradigm	shift.		
The	proposed	solutions	are	deliberately	extraordinary	and	revolutionary	and	militate	
for	the	abandonment	of	the	mainstream	model	in	favor	of	a	new,	bimetric	model	.		
To	quote	a	well-known	aphorism,	"extraordinary	claims	demand	extraordinary	
evidence".	It	is	therefore	necessary	to	list	these	claims.	
Some	points	:		
2	–	Justification	of	the	shape	of	the	rotation	curves.	
3	–	Explanation	of	overspeeds	in	clusters	of	galaxies.	
4	–	Explanation	of	the	strong	gravitational	lens	effect.	
are	only	alternative	interpretations	to	those	provided	by	the	hypothesis	of	the	
existence	of	dark,	matter,	which	they	do	not	invalidate.	These	interpretations	simply	
show	that	the	proposed	model	is	not	contradicted	by	these	observations.		
But	in	the	following	points	:		
	1	:	Nature	of	primordial	antimatter	and	explanation	of	its	non-observation.

observed	universe.	
8	–	Description	of	the	object	giving	rise	to	the	formation	that	was	given	the

are	provided	theoretical	interpretations	that	do	not	emanate	from	the	standard	model	
ΛCDM.	Precise	answers	are	given	where	the	standard	model	does	not	provide	any.		
This	paradigm	shift	can	be	summed	up	in	a	simple	sentence:		
Before	describing	how	we	proceeded	it	is	essential	to	show	why	this	hypothesis	has	not	
been	able	to	emerge	to	date.		
	2	–	The	runaway	effect,	a	barrier	against	the	introduction	of	negative	masses.	
This	question	of	the	introduction	of	negative	masses	was	tackled	as	early	as	1957	by	H.	
Bondi	[8]	and	then	in	1989	by	W.	Bonnor	[9].	It	is	important	to	make	it	clear	why	this	
causes	the	appearance	of	a	phenomenon	that	is	difficult	to	manage	in	physics,	the	
runaway	effect,	if	only	because	it	violates	the	principle	of	action-reaction.			
By	ignoring	the	non-linearity	of	Einstein's	equation,	we	can	schematize	it	by	saying	that	
in	the	second	member	is	the	source	of	the	gravitational	field.	The	equation	provides	a	
solution	in	the	form	of	a	single	metric	from	which	one	calculates	sets	of	geodesics,	
corresponding	to	non-zero	geodesics	(masses)	and	null	geodesics	(photons).	The	
cosmological	constant	can	be	abstracted	for	this	question.

	First	paradox:	the	positive	mass	flees,	pursued	by	the	negative	mass,	in	violation	of	the	
principle	of	action-reaction.		
Second	paradox:	the	couple	accelerates	indefinitely,	but	this	increase	in	speed	takes	
place	at	constant	energy	since	the	kinetic	energy	of	the	negative	mass	is	itself	negative.		
	3	–	Two	attempts	to	introduce	negative	masses	in	Einstein's	model	
These	attempts	remained	within	the	geometric	framework	of	General	Relativity,	
described	by	Einstein's	field	equation.		
In	the	first	one	(Benoit-Lévy	a	G.	Chardin	[10]),	the	authors	take	Dirac-Milne's	model,	
where	the	positive	and	negative	mass	contents	give	a	globally	null	density.	The	
expansion	then	takes	place	in	a	linear	way,	in	contradiction	with	the	evidence	of	cosmic	
acceleration	([3],	[4],	[5]).	The	authors	propose	that	the	negative	mass	may	correspond	
to	antimatter.	They	imagine,	without	providing	any	scientific	support,	that	this	
cosmological	antimatter	could	be	repelled	by	ordinary	matter	by	suggesting	that	this	
phenomenon	could	manifest	itself	during	the	experiments	being	set	up	at	CERN,	Gbar	
and	Alpha,	intended	to	highlight	the	behavior	of	antimatter	created	in	the	laboratory,	in	
the	Earth's	gravity	field.		
In	the	second	one	in	2018	[11],	the	Englishman	Jamie	Farnes	plans	to	unify	dark	matter	
and	dark	energy	into	a	single	entity,	identified	with	negative	mass.	
To	do	so	he	is	forced	to	invoke	an	undescribed	phenomenon	of	constant	creation	of	
negative	mass,	keeping	its	density	constant	throughout	the	cosmic	expansion,	so	as	to	
guarantee	the	constancy	of	the	negative	cosmological	constant,	according	to	the	relation.

Since	his	model	is	always	presented	as	a	solution	to	Einstein's	equation,	the	runaway	
phenomenon	is	automatically	part	of	it,	which	he	then	considers	as	the	mechanism	
producing	the	high-energy	particles	constituting	cosmic	rays.	And	he	concludes:	"From	
this	perspective	the	runaway	motion	is	not	a	challenge	for	negative	mass	models,	but	a	
rather	useful	observational	constrainst".		
What	is	however	interesting	is	a	simulation	result	where	a	Hernquist	galaxy,	composed	
of	5,000	positive	mass	points,	is	surrounded	by	45,000	negative	masses	
	These	negative	masses,	exerting	their	repulsive	action	on	the	components	of	this	galaxy,	
makes	possible	high	rotational	speeds	at	the	periphery.	On	figure	4	the	red	curve	gives	
the	profile	of	the	rotation	curve	for	this	galaxy,	whereas	the	black	curve	represents	this	
profile	in	the	absence	of	the	negative	mass	environment:		

	

	4	–	Empirical	approach,	simulation	results	
In	the	mid-nineties	[12],	numerical	simulations	were	used	to	explore	the	behavior	of	a	
mixture	of	positive	and	negative	masses,	satisfying	the	principle	of	action-reaction,	i.e.	
according	to	hypothetical	laws:		
(4)	

	
10	
	The	first	result	did	not	bring	any	element	likely	to	orient	research	in	astrophysics.	A	
percolation	of	the	two	species	was	then	observed.	See	figure	5:		

-	The	masses	of	opposite	signs	repel	each	other	according	to	"anti-Newton".		

-	Masses	of	the	same	sign	attract	each	other	according	to	Newton's	law.	

	

	
An	idea	then	emerged,	consisting	in	considering	the	behavior	of	a	mixture	of	positive

where	the	negative	mass	is	dominant.	The	following	result	was	then	obtained:

Although	they	are	only	2D	simulations,	very	primitive,	carried	out	with	two	times	5,000	
mass	points,	the	creation	of	a	lacunar	structure	of	the	positive	mass	appeared.	In	the	
center	of	each	cell:	a	negative	mass	conglomerate,	repulsive.	The	negative	masses,	
denser,	formed	the	first,	by	gravitational	instability,	a	regular	distribution	of	negative

mass	conglomerates,	repelling	the	positive	mass	into	the	interstitial	space.	The	idea	
emerged	that	the	large-scale	structure	of	the	universe	could	result	from	such	a	
mechanism,	implying	a	deep	asymmetry	between	the	two	populations.	Below	are	the	
Jeans	times	of	the	two	populations.	The	Jeans	time	of	the	negative,	self-attractive	
population,	being	weaker,	structured	itself	first,	leading	the	game.

Assuming	that	these	negative	masses,	of	negative	mc2	energy,	emit	photons	of	negative	
energy	that	do	not	produce	any	optical	observation,	it	seemed	possible	that	the	very	
large	scale	structure	(VLS)	is	organized	around	basically	invisible	conglomerates	of	
negative	mass.	See	further	the	question	of	the	Great	Repeller.		
	5	–	First	attempt	at	bimetric	modeling.		
Nevertheless	the	results	of	the	numerical	simulations	were	encouraging.	To	try	to	
integrate	the	interaction	laws	(4)	in	a	relativistic	framework	was	the	obvious	fact	rest.	
With	a	single	field	equation	and	a	single	metric	the	runaway	effect	was	inevitable.	To	
avoid	it,	the	field	had	to	generate	not	one	family	of	geodesics,	but	two,	the	first

but	the	system	(5)	+	(6)	refused	to	produce	the	asymmetry	that	had	proved	so	fruitful	in

When	a	FLRW	metric	is	introduced	into	Einstein's	equation,	two	differential	equations	
are	obtained	which	contain	the	first	and	second	derivatives	of	the	scale	factor	 a.	
Compatibility	between	these	two	equations	(existence	of	solution)	results	in	energy	
conservation:

With	two	equations	we	have	four	equations	that	must	be	compatible.	In	the	case	of	
equations	(5)	+	(6)	it	is	these	compatibility	conditions	that	lead	to	an	uninteresting	
trivial	solution	(Dirac	Milne's	model).		But	the	system:

in	which	two	FLRW	metrics	are	introduced	then	leads	to	the	following	condition	of	
compatibility	between	the	two	pairs	of	equations		
(14)																																														  ρ(+) a(+)3c(+)2 + ρ(−) a(−)3c(−)2 = Cst	
Which	is	nothing	but	energy	conservation.	It	was	desirable	to	produce	a	Lagrangian	
derivation	of	these	equations	from	an	action.	We	produced	one	in	2015	[15],	which	
turned	out	to	be	quite	close	to	that	of	S.	Hossenfelder	[16]	but	hers	seemed	to	be	more	
solid	and	this	is	why	we	chose	to	link	our	own	work	to	her.	
The	editorial	board	said	that	in	the	previous	writing	of	the	article	it	was	said,	we	quote:		
In	what	follows	we	will	show	that	her	work	could	not	lead	to	a	true	cosmological	model	
and	to	a	set	of	computational	results	that	could	be	successfully	confronted	with	the	
observations,	because	she	did	not	see	that	these	required	exploring	the	hypothesis	of	a	
very	asymmetrical	world,	where	densities,	speeds	of	light,	scale	factors	are	radically	
different.	This	is	the	reason	why	she	could	not	develop	her	essay.		

For example, the text around the discussion of  Hossenfelder’s work is so 
confused that I cannot tell if the authors are criticizing that work or building 
off it (or both).

They	consider	two	branes,	«	right	»	and	«	left	»,	interacting	through	massive	gravitons.	They	
introduce	Lagrangian	densities	in	the	action	:	the	Ricci	terms	 RRLR − g R	,	 RL − g L,	the

	and

corresponding	
the

based	on	an	«	average	volume	factor	»	
system	of	two	coupled	field	equations.	In	the	second	members	are	the	tensors	representing	
the	sources	of	the	two	materials	"right"	and	"left"	as	well	as	the	terms	and	reflecting	the	
interaction	between	the	two.	The	authors	then	consider	different	models:	branes,	KK,	non-
commutative	geometry.	This	first	article	is	quickly	followed	by	a	second	[20].	The	scientific	
community	apparently	considered	at	the	time	that	this	essay	represented	an	important	
contribution	since	the	journal	Physical	Review	D	devoted	17	and	25	pages	to	these	two	
articles,	despite	the	fact	that	no	data	emerged	that	can	be	compared	with	any	observational	
data.			
		7	–	Bimetric	theory	with	exchange	symmetry.		
	In	2008	[16]	S.	Hossenfelder	published	in	the	journal	PRD	a	theoretical	essay	entitled	"	
Bimetric	theory	with	exchange	symmetry".	As	she	says	in	her	section	I,	we	quote:		
	
	
These	are	the	same	metrics	that,	in	our	own	work,	are	called	   g(+) and g(−).	For	the	
sake	of	homogeneity	we	will	keep	the	notations	of	her	paper.		
	
Still	in	this	section	I,	she	writes	:	
		
	

«	We	will	further	introduce	two	sorts	of	matter	on	M	:	one	that	moves	according	
to	the	usual	metric	g	and	the	measures	it	implies,	the	other	that	moves	according	
to	 the	 other	 metric	 h .	 We	 will	 refer	 to	 these	 fields	 as	 g-fields	 and	 h-fields,	
respectively.	»		

«	We	 consider	 a	 bi-metric	 theory	 with	 metrics	 g	 and	 h 	of	 Lorentzian	 signature	
that	define	two	different	ways	of	measuring	angles,	distances	and	volumes	on	a	
manifold	M		»	.

Using	her	"pull	over"	technique,	she	defines	an	action	that	corresponds	to	equation	(32)	in	
her	section	IV:			
	
	

	
-	  
(g ) R and (h)R	are	Ricci's	scalars	associated	with	its	metrics	g	and	 h.		
	-	 g and hbeing	the	determinants	of	both	metrics,	  d 4x − g and d 4x − h 	are	
the	corresponding	4-volumes.		
	-	 Ψ	is	the	g-field	and	 Φ	the	h-fields	
	
She	then	performs	a	"bi-variation".	It	is	then	necessary	to	introduce	a	coupling	relation,	
which	she	does	with	equation	(27)	in	section	III	
	
		This	is	the	covariant	version	of	the	coupling	relationship	that	we	used	in	our	article	[15],	in	
a	work	subsequent	to	hers.	Hence	the	obvious	kinship	between	the	two	systems	of	coupled	
field	equations.	Hers	corresponds	to	equations	(34)	and	(35)	in	section	IV	of	her	article,	and	
is	written	as	follows:

	The	other	two	equations	and	the	associated	compatibility	equations	are	not	present.	It	
should	be	remembered,	as	can	be	seen	in	the	content	of	her	conclusions	in	section	VII,	that

followed,	the	density	 ρ> 0is	positive,	which	has	been	imposed	in	such	a	way	that	evolution	
equations	(42)	and	(43)	lead	to	similar	evolutions.	It	is	only	by	making	a	peculiar	choice	of

		8	–	Confusing	 conclusions	 and	 a	 lack	 of	 elements	 that	 could	 be	 compared	 with	 the	
observations	in	the	2008	article	of	S.Hossenfelder.	
Using	the	phrase	from	the	editorial	board	:	
	For example, the text around the discussion of  Hossenfelder’s work is so 
Our	answer	is	that	the	Lagrangian	derivation	operated	by	Sabine	Hossenfelder	is	
mathematically	exact,	so	that	this	construction	of	coupled	field	equations	can	be	retained	as	
a	method	of	constructing	a	bimetric	system.	On	the	other	hand,	her	article	ends	in	confusion.	
We	will	quote	excerpts	from	part	VII	of	his	article.	
	
	The	proposal	is	perfectly	clear.	It	envisages	the	introduction	of	a	negative	energy	content
  E = m c 2 < 0,	thus	corresponding	to	elements	  m < 0,	therefore	of	negative	mass.	It	would	
therefore	have	been	logical	to	introduce	an	equally	negative	mass	density	ρ.	At	this	stage	
one	is	looking	at	how	these	masses m and minteract.	While	this	is	a	major	element	of	the	
approach	this	is	not	immediately	and	clear	(which	can	be	done	immediately	thanks	to	the	
Newtonian	limt).	These	answers	have	to	be	found	in	the	text.	In	section	V	we	read	:	
	

-	«	In	the	previous	section	we	have	studied	the	extension	of	GR	in	whose	framework	
sources	 with	 negative	 energy	 appears	 in	 the	 equations	».These	 additional	 h-fields	
interact	only	with	our	standard	matter,	and	thus	couple	only	extremely	weakly.	»		

confused that I cannot tell if the authors are criticizing that work or building 
off it (or both). 

-	«	Since	both	kinds	of	matter	repel,	one	would	expect	the	amount	of	the	h-matter	in	
our	vicinity	to	presently	be	very	small	».		

-	«	We	further	investigated	the	spherical	symmetric	example	with	the	source	of	usual	
matter,	and	we	found	that	the	newly	introduced	particles	would	be	repelled	by	this	
source	».		

17	
-	«	Since	 h	is	just	a	Schwarzscild	metric	with	negative	(…)	source	one	see	e.g.	by	
taking	the	Newtonian	limit	thet	a	h-particle	will	be	repelled	by	the	g-source.	»		

	
	In	section	VIII	we	find:		
	
	Translation	:	a	masse	m	repels	a	mass	 m	.		
	As	confirmation,	the	author	writes	in	section	V:		
	
	So	there	is	mutual	repulsion	of	these	masses	 m and m,	even	though	the	mass	densities	
 ρand ρ	are	both	positive	(...).		
	But	while	S.Hossenfelder	is	an	excellent	mathematician,	she	seems	less	comfortable	with	
physics	questions.	She	thinks	she	can	simplify	calculations	by	taking	all	constants	equal	to	
unity,	and	does	the	same	for	Einstein's	constant	 χ.	However,	the	Einstein	constant	is	
fundamentally	negative.	In	this	logic	she	should	have	given	it	the	value	-	1.		It	is	this	choice	
that	dictates	her	choice	of	signs	in	her	field	equations,	a	source	of	confusion.		
	
The	fact	of	invoking	the	weakness	of	gravitational	interaction	would	only	make	sense	if	this	
force	was	compared	to	another	force,	essentially	the	electromagnetic	interaction	force	1039	
times	greater.	The	latter	is	absent	in	cosmological	models	where	the	cosmic	scenario,	
involving	isotropy	and	homogeneity,	includes	the	fundamental	assumption	of	the	electrical	
neutrality	of	the	universe,	otherwise	the	smallest	charge	would	lead	to	a	very	violent	
expansion.	In	this	sentence	S.	Hossenfelder	means	that	the	existence	of	this	entity	of	
negative	mass	would	couple	weakly	with	positive	mass,	whereas	the	interactions	 m ↔ m	
are	of	the	same	order	of	magnitude	as	the	interactions	 m ↔ m.			
	Further	on:		
	
	She	therefore	considers	her	trial	as	a	simple	modification	of	the	standard	model.	Thus	the	
phenomenon	represented	by	this	"weak"	coupling	of	the	h-field	with	the	g-field,	would	be	at	
the	origin	of	this	negative	energy	of	the	vacuum,	translated	by	the	presence	of	the	
cosmological	constant	in	Einstein's	equation.	Consequently	she	writes		:		
	
	It	is	then	easier	to	understand	why	she	chooses	to	pose	 ρ> 0	,	which	gives	it	identical	
evolutionary	equations	(42)	and	(43),	when	she	considers	a	mixture	of	two	similar	entities.	

	-	«	The	model	we	laid	out	is	purely	classical.	Nevertheless	it	is	worthwhile	to	consider	
the	vacuum	expectation	value	of	the	stress-energy	tensor	for	quantum	fields	that	are	
coupled	to	the	classical	background.	»	

-	 «	We	 will	 assume	 that	 the	 field	 content	 for	 both,	 the	 g-field	 and	 the	 h-field,	 is	
identical	such	that	we	wave	e.g.	two	copies	of	the	Standard	Model	».		

-	«	Wether	or	not	this	solution	is	stable	or	would	run	away	is	the	constants	did	not	
exactly	cancel	requires	further	investigation.	»		

-	«	If	we	consider	the	vacuum	solution	in	the	model	with	exchange	symmetry	however,	
we	 expect	 a	 symmetry	 between	 both	 metrics.	 In	 the	 case	 with	 maximal	 number	 of	
space-time	 symmetries,	 both	 would	 just	 be	 the	 Minkowski	 metric.	 We	 then	 have	
  h / g = 1	and	the	pull	over	are	just	identity.	Since	the	matter	content	of	both	types	of	
fields	is	identical	(…),	this	means	that	the	source	terms	in	equations	(34)		and	(35)	
cancel	identically,	,no	matter	how	large	their	values	are.	»		

	
18	
The	world	of	negative	masses	represents	for	her	a	kind	of	ghostly	entity	which	by	its	
contribution	to	the	gravitational	field	would	not	bring	in	itself	a	perturbance	sensitive	to	
cosmic	dynamics	("two	copies	of	the	Standard	Model")	but	would	reveal	its	presence	
through	fluctuations	which	would	then	be	the	source	of	the	effect	attributed	to	vacuum	
energy,	to	the	cosmological	constant.	The	author	then	focuses	her	interest	on	the	regions	of	
the	universe	that	are	free	of	matter,	on	its	"empty"	regions,	and	she	writes	:	
	
	The	reasoning	here	becomes	contradictory.	The	model	no	longer	corresponds	to	"two	copies	
of	the	standard	model".	Field	equations	with	null	second	members	lead	to	the	Dirac-Milne	
model	with	linear	expansion	as	a	function	of	time.	These	hypothetical	middle	fluctuations	
are	not	described.	One	simply	reads:		
	
	It	is	therefore	not	known	how	an	instability	of	this	vacuum,	presented	as	a	mixture	of	two	
types	of	matter	with	identical	densities,	could	generate	a	field	corresponding	to	a	negative	
energy	density,	two	orders	of	magnitude	greater	than	the	gravitational	field	associated	with	
ordinary	matter,	causing	the	acceleration	of	the	expansion	translated	by	the	observations	of	
high-redshift	supernovae.			
	
She	writes:		
	
	Indeed,	how	can	one	hope	to	create	a	field	one	hundred	times	more	intense	than	the	field	
due	to	ordinary	matter	from	fluctuations	appearing	in	an	environment	where,	locally,	the	
density	of	the	second	matter	is	of	the	same	order	of	magnitude?		
	
And	she	concludes:	
	
	
Very	intense	fluctuations,	produced	by	what	mechanism?	
	And	we	read:		
	
	

«	Since	 we	 now	 have	 only	 gravitationnally	 interacting	 density	 contribution	 that	 is	
negative,	and	one	further	would	hope	for	symmetry	reason	that	both	densities	are	of	
the	same	order	of	magnitude	(…)	the	total	gravitating	density	can	be	smaller	than	the	
observed	one.	Then	the	relative	density	fluctuations	can	be	smaller	than	the	observed	
one	».	

-	«	Besides	this,	both	components	of	matter	repel	each	other	which	is	an	effect	usually	
not	present	».		

-	«	Then	the	relative	density	fluctuations	could	be	larger	».	

	
19	
Of	course,	since	in	the	model	ΛCDM	with	which	she	tries	to	stick,	the	confinement	of	galaxies,	
the	flatness	of	their	rotation	curves	is	interpreted	by	the	presence	of	a	halo	of	dark	matter.		
To	conclude,	Sabine	Hossenfelder	sees	in	the	negative	gravitational	lens	effect	associated	
with	the	Schwarzschild	Solutions	joined	together,	evoked	in	section	III,	the	only	possibility	
of	putting	hypothetical	fluctuations	signalling,	in	vacuum,	regions	constituting	localized	
sources	of	negative	energy.	She	writes:		
	

	

-	 «	Another	 feature	 of	 the	 scenario	 becomes	 clear	 from	 the	 previously	 discussed	
example	 of	 the	 Schwarzschild	 metric.	 If	 there	 was	 a	 localized	 source	 of	 negative	
energy,	it	would	act	as	a	gravitational	lens-but	unlike	usual	matter	this	would	be	a	
diverging	lens	since	it	would	repel	our	(usual)	photons.	Such	a	lensing	event	would	
typically	 lower	 the	 luminosity	 of	 the	 source,	 an	 effect	 that	 could	 potentially	 add	 up	
over	 distance	 if	 the	 contribution	 of	 such	 sources	 is	 substantial.	 The	 detection	 of	
diffractive	 lensing	 event	 could	 serve	 as	 a	 smoking	 gun	 for	 the	 here	 proposed	
scenario	?	».	

	S.	Hossenfelder	rediscovers	here	the	effect	that	we	had	already	described	in	1995	[12].		
	
In	conclusion,	as	a	good	mathematician,	well	versed	in	the	techniques	of	differential	
geometry	and	the	calculation	of	variations,	she	gave	in	2008	a	coherent	and	solid	
mathematical	foundation	to	a	model	we	introduced	in	1994	in	its	infancy,	essentially	
supported	by	numerical	simulations.	
	But,	like	Pyrrhus,	she	has	not	been	able	to	exploit	the	physical	implications	of	her	work,	
allowing	a	confrontation	with	observations.	
		9	–	Adaptation	of	the	system	of	coupled	field	equations.		
	We	are	going	to	adapt	her	own	model,	by	modifying	the	signs,	that	is	to	say	by	considering	
that	the	density		 ρ< 0	and	the	pressure	  p < 0	are	this	time	negative.	We	assume	a	priori	
that	the	speeds	of	light c and c		as	well	as	the	curvature	indices	 k and k	may	be	different.	
We	will	make	the	cosmological	constant	reappear	(half	present	in	the	expression	of	the	
action	through	the	factor	  8πG,	which	then	disappears).		There	is	no	reason	why	Einstein's	
constants	 χand χ	in	the	equations	should	be	a	priori	identical.	Under	these	conditions	we	
will	write	the	FLRW	metrics	(in	a	more	classical	form).	Following	the	same	mathematical	
path	but	modifying	the	signs,	the	system	of	the	two	coupled	field	equations	is	written	as	
follows:	
	(19)																																
	(20)																														
	As	far	as	Schwarzschild's	external	solutions	are	concerned,	nothing	has	changed.	But	the	
"second	masses"	are	negative,	as	well	as	density	and	pressure	  ( m < 0 , p < 0 , ρ< 0 ).	To

consider	the	evolution	of	this	system	of	two	interacting	materials,	we	will	write	the	FLRW	
metrics,	allowing	the	system	to	have	two	speeds	of	light.	One	speed	c	for	(ordinary	photons)	
of	positive	energy	and	one	speed	 c	for	photons	of	negative	energy,	travelling	according	to	
the	geodetic	null	of	the	metric	h.	
	(19)																																											
	(20)																																											
	So	we	have	a	single	manifold	 M	equipped	with	two	metrics	 g	and	 h	.	The	cosmic	history	
resulting	from	the	introduction	of	these	metrics	in	the	field	equations	will	be	translated	by	
the	functions	giving	the	evolution	of	the	scale	factors	  a(t) and b(t).	We	write	the	system	of	
field	equations	in	mixed	form:	
	(21)	
	(22)	
	The	source	tensors	of	the	field	are	given	the	form:

	By	introducing	these	metrics	into	the	equations	we	obtain	two	pairs	of	differential	equations,	
													  
the	first	pair	containing	the	first	and	second	derivatives	of	the	corresponding	scale	factor	a	
and	the	second	pair	containing	the	first	and	second	derivatives	of	the	second	scale	factor	b.

	As	the	measurements	referring	to	our	matter	dominated	era	show	an	acceleration,	we	
deduce	that	the	global	energy	 E	is	negative.	Negative	mass	dominates.		This	confirms	the	
hypothesis	that	had	prevailed	to	lead	to	interesting	numerical	simulations.	Equation	(42)	
imposes	that	the	index	of	curvature	k	is	-1.	As	a	consequence,	all	the	negative	masses	are	in	a	
state	of	deceleration.	These	equations	are	therefore	written:

				10	–	An	universe	dominated	by	negative	mass.	
	We	can	then	write	equation	(46)	according	as:		
	(48)																																																								
	The	exact	solution	of	such	an	equation	has	been	given	by	William	Bonnor	[9].	Only	the	
part	of	the	solution	corresponding	to	the	matter	dominated	era	can	be	considered.		By	
pushing	this	solution	to	the	origin	of	time,	the	zero	value	of	the	chronological	variable,	
the	mathematical	solution	gives	a	non-zero	scale	factor	a	value.	The	model	accounts	for	
the	acceleration	of	the	expansion.	([3],[4],[5]).	The	mainstream	ΛCDM	model	predicts	an	
exponential	expansion	related	to	the	fact	that	the	energy-matter	equivalent	of	the	
cosmological	constant	remains	unchanged	when	the	universe	expands.	Conversely,	the	
density	of	negative	mass	decreases	and	equation	(46)	assigns	an	asymptote	to	this	
expansion.		
	
The	comparison	of	the	predictions	of	this	model	with	the	data	of	700	type	Ia	supernovae

So	the	system	becomes:		
(50)																																			
(51)																																	
The	first	equation	is	simply	that	of	the	classical	GR.	So	all	local	verifications	like	the	
explanation	of	the	advance	of	Mercury's	perihelion	and	the	deviation	of	light	rays	by	the

	12	–	Galaxy	modeling.		
It	has	been	possible	to	build	a	model	of	a	galaxy	with	spherical	symmetry	surrounded	by	
negative	mass,	the	latter	having	a	confining	effect	on	it.	Self-gravitating	stellar	systems	
had	already	been	modeled	in	1942	by	S.Chandrasekhar	[20]	using	a	solution	of	the	
Maxwell-Botzmann	type	of	the	Vlasov	equation,	coupled	with	the	Poisson	equation.	The

We	can	then	consider	two	Vlasov	equations,	written	in	terms	of	residual	velocities,	
coupled	by	the	Poisson	equation.	These	equations	are	written:

∇!vo = 0	
(56)																														
∇!vo = 0	
The	terms	   
∇!vo	are	the	dyadic	matrices	[23]	formed	from	the	different	vectors	
and	gradients.	The	term	   
∇!vo	represents	the	scalar	product	of	two	dyads	defined	
j.	The	logarithm	of	Maxwell	Boltzmann's

spheroidal	galaxies,	clusters	of	galaxies	and,	in	the	case	of	galaxies,	allows	to	reconstruct	
the	flatness	of	their	rotation	curves.	See	a	more	recent	result	on	figure	4	[11].	These	
objects	of	positive	mass	are	thus	housed	in	gaps	in	the	negative	mass	distribution.	This	
gap	being	equivalent	to	an	equivalent	positive	mass,	this	one	will	be	the	main	
responsible	for	the	observed	gravitational	lens	effects.	The	model	therefore	accounts	for	
this	set	of	observations.	From	this	point	of	view	it	is	an	alternative	to	the	dark	matter	
model,	but	does	not	invalidate	the	existence	of	the	latter.	
	Note:	It	is	unfortunate	that	we	do	not	have	the	possibility	to	develop	a	galaxy	formation	
scenario	using	simulations.	The	process	of	constitution	of	the	large-scale	structure	
highlights	a	new	phenomenon:	the	intense	compression	of	the	positive	mass,	due	to	the	
repulsive	effect	of	two	adjacent	negative-mass	conglomerates,	resulting	in	the	heating	of	
this	matter	in	plates,	offering	an	optimal	geometry	for	a	rapid	radiative	cooling,	favoring	
the	formation	of	primitive	galaxies.		
	
A	solid	body	rotation	is	then	introduced.	The	following	image	comes	from	numerical	
simulations	carried	out	at	the	DAISY	laboratory	in	Hamburg	in	1992	by	the	student	
Frédéric	Descamp.	In	a	few	turns,	after	a	transient	regime,	a	barred	spiral	is	formed,	
lasting	for	thirty	turns	[23].

	The	evolution	of	the	kinetic	moment	of	the	galaxy,	along	with	the	establishment	of	its	
rotation	curve	differing	from	the	initial	solid	body	rotation,	is	as	follows:		
	

	

	
Fig.11	:	Evolution	of	the	kinetic	moment	(1992	:	2x10,000	points)	

		We	are	in	the	presence	of	a	phenomenon	of	dynamical	friction.	In	collision	dominated	
systems,	the	transfer	of	kinetic	moment	and	energy	takes	place	by	collisions.	In	non-
collisional	systems	these	exchanges,	which	reflect	the	dissipative	mode	in	these	
environments,	are	carried	out	via	the	appearance	of	inhomogeneities,	density	waves	
also	called	tidal	effects.	The	interaction	implies	that	the	shape	of	the	density	waves	in	

	
29	
the	positive	world	finds	its	counterpart	in	the	negative	world.	The	curve	above	shows	
that	the	interaction	is	intense	when	the	negative	mass	environment	is	present	and	when	
the	galaxy	rotates	as	a	solid	body,	which	is	also	revealed	in	the	images	of	the	transient	
phase.	The	variation	decreases	when	the	galaxy	has	reached	its	differential	rotation	
regime	with	flatness	of	the	curve	at	the	periphery.	These	simulations	could	only	be	
carried	out	in	Germany	for	a	few	months,	as	the	student	was	quickly	called	to	order	by	
his	hierarchy.	As	we	had	no	access	to	adequate	computing	resources	in	France,	we	had	
to	abandon	this	research	direction	with	regret.	In	addition,	in	spite	of	the	strong	
mathematical	support,	the	specialized	journals	rejected	these	works	without	reading	
them	and	replied	"sorry,	we	don't	publish	speculative	works"..		
	13-	Large-scale	structure,	the	problem	of	the	Great	Repeller.	
In	2017	[7]	a	very	large	scale	map	of	the	universe	is	published,	covering	a	cube	of	one	
and	a	half	billion	light	years	on	each	side.	This	mapping	is	accompanied	by	a	
presentation	of	the	velocity	field	which	highlights	the	existence	of	a	vast	spheroidal	
region	exerting	a	repulsive	effect	on	the	surrounding	galaxies	and	which	has	been	
named	Great	Repeller.		
	

	

Fig.12	:	The	Great	Repeller	

	The	model	interprets	this	observation	as	the	presence	of	one	of	the	negative	mass	
conglomerates	determining	the	structure	of	the	universe	on	a	very	large	scale,	formed	
by	the	gravitational	instability	of	the	negative,	self-attracting	mass	.	The	dark	matter	
hypothesis	does	not	provide	an	answer	in	the	sense	that	no	scenario	is	proposed	that	
would	justify	the	existence	of	a	large	void.			
	This	scheme	of	a	distribution	of	conglomerates	of	negative	mass	would	then	have	the	
consequence	of	weakening	the	luminosity	of	distant	sources	by	negative	gravitational	
lens	effect.	This	is	exactly	what	is	observed	for	redshift	galaxies	greater	than	7.

As	it	stands,	the	negative	mass	model	presents	itself	as	a	credible	alternative	and	the	
results	obtained	deserve	to	be	brought	to	the	attention	of	the	scientific	community	so	
that	my	subject	can	be	discussed.	But	we	will	move	on	to	other	areas	of	research	where	
dark	matter	does	not	provide	answers.	
	Insofar	as	the	present	model,	with	respect	to	these	aspects,	presents	itself	as	an	
alternative	to	the	mainstream	model	ΛCDM	the	relative	importance	of	the	negative	mass	
is	the	same	as	that	of	the	set	dark	matter	plus	dark	energy:		
	

	

	
	
Fig.13	:	The	components	
		14	–	Primordial	antimatter,	nature	of	the	negative	mass.		
	In	the	accepted	scientific	scheme,	matter	and	antimatter	are	formed	from	primitive	
radiation,	as	long	as	the	energy	of	photons	exceeds	the	energy	equivalent	of	these	
matter-antimatter	pairs.	When	the	expansion	lowers	this	temperature	these	syntheses	
cease	and	these	elements	disappear	by	annihilation.	Fossil	radiation	is	considered	as	the	
remnant	of	these	annihilations.	There	is	currently	no	theoretical	model	that	explains	
why	one	particle	of	matter	in	a	billion	remained,	nor	why	we	have	never	had	to	highlight	
its	counterpart	in	the	form	of	primordial	antimatter.		
	The	Russian	Andrei	Sakharov	[24]	started	from	a	synthesis	image	of	baryons	from	
quarks	and	antiquarks	from	anti-baryons.	According	to	him	the	rate	of	synthesis	of	
baryons	would	have	been	faster	than	that	of	anti-baryons.	The	expansion	would	have	
frozen	this	situation	and	there	would	exist	in	our	universe	a	remnant	of	free	antiquarks,	
in	the	ratio	three	to	one.	He	further	suggested	that	a	twin	universe	would	coexist	with	
our	universe,	which	would	have	known	an	opposite	situation	and	where	anti-baryons	
and	quarks	would	subsist	in	the	free	state.	He	also	suggested	that	the	time	arrow	of	this	
other	universe	would	be	opposite	to	ours	and	that	it	would	be	enantiomorphic.	But	he	
had	not	envisaged	the	involvement	of	these	two	regions.	Below	is	a	didactic	image	
illustrating	Sakharov's	model.

Fig	.15	:	Link	to	the	Sakharov	model	

	One	can	imagine	a	reversal	of	time	at	the	time	of	the	Big	Bang,	a	situation	that	brings	a	
form	of	answer	to	the	question	"what	was	there	before	the	Big	Bang".	
	It	so	happens	that	in	1970	the	French	mathematician	J.M.Souriau	brought	an	original	
answer	to	T-symmetry.	His	approach	is	the	following.	Starting	from	Minkowski's	
isometry	group,	the	 complete	Poincaré	group,	he	determines,	by	the	technique	of	the	
group's	coadjoint	action	on	the	dual	of	his	Lie	algebra	[25],	the	characteristics	of	the	
motions	of	the	different	particles	that	inscribe	their	motions	in	it.	These	objects	are	of	
two	kinds:	
	
-	Photons,	characterized	by	their	E	energy	and	spin	s.			
	-	Particles	with	an	energy	E	(with	a	rest	mass	m,	according	to	E	=	mc2)	and	an	
impulse	p.

P	is	the	energy-impulsion	4-vector	and		p	the	impulsion	3-vector.		:		
	
(63)																																																													
	From	the	examination	of	these	relations	(62)	and	(63)	we	find	the	result	of	Souriau	([25]	
page	190,	equation	(14.7)	):		
	
	So	that	the	analysis	of	the	properties	of	space-time	shows	that	T-symmetric	motions	
should	be	included,	that	would	simply	be	those	of	particles	of	opposite	energy,	for	
photons,	and	of	negative	mass	for	matter.	Until	2011	nothing	emerged	from	our	physics	
that	could	give	credit	to	this	idea.	But	the	discovery	of	the	acceleration	of	expansion,	
attributed	to	the	action	of	negative	energy,	gave	credence	to	the	idea	that	there	could	
exist	particles	with	negative	energy,	which	could	be	particles	with	negative	mass	and	
photons	with	negative	energy.	This	possibility	of	inversion	of	the	time	coordinate	can	be	
read	in	any	case	in	the	expression	of	the	metric,	invariant	by	T-symmetry,	P-symmetry	
and	PT-symmetry:		
	(64)																																																	  ds2 = c2dt 2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2		
	But	this	inversion	of	the	time	coordinate	t	does	not	automatically	mean	the	inversion	of	
the	proper	time	s	!		
	The	cosmological	model	hosts	negative	masses	and	negative	energy	photons	that	and	
our	instruments	cannot	capture.	It	is	a	simple	extension	of	Minkowski's	geometry	.	As	
this	inversion	goes	hand	in	hand	with	the	inversion	of	time	we	call	it:		
	
	The	two	folds	are	linked	by	a	PT-symmetry	relationship,	like	Sakharov's	twin	universes.		
	
The	matter-antimatter	duality	finds	its	geometrical	translation	by	inscribing	the	
movements	in	a	Kaluza	5D	space.	The	corresponding	group	is	then	translated	by	the	
matrices	(5.5):

	The	value	  µ= −1represents	a	C-symmetry.	This	doubles	the	number	of	related

	Matter/antimatter	symmetry	is	geometrically	translated	by	the	inversion	of	the	fifth

to	the	inversion	of	energy	and	mass.	This	Λ-symmetry	is	that	which	corresponds	to	the	
Janus	cosmological	model.	By	adding	the	value	  µ= −1we	install	the	duality	of	
antimatter	in	the	world	of	negative	masses.

	So	there	are	two	antimatters:		
	-	The	C-symmetric	of	ordinary	antimatter,	with	positive	mass	and	positive	energy.	
Let	us	call	it	"antimatter	in	the	sense	of	Dirac".	
	-	The	PT-antimatter,		PT-symmetric	of	our	own	matter,	with	negative	mass	and	
negative	energy,	which	we	will	call	antimatter	in	the	sense	of	Feynmann.		
	
If	Sakharov's	idea	is	then	implemented,	the	world	of	negative	masses	would	be	
populated	with	antimatter	of	negative	mass	and	energy.	Essentially:		
	-	Negative	mass	antiprotons	
	-	Negative	mass	anti-neutrons	
	-	Negative	mass	anti-electrons	
	-	Photons	of	negative	energy	
	-	A	residue	of	negative	energy	quarks.		
	It	is	of	course	impossible	to	highlight	these	components	individually,	especially	since	
this	negative	mass	is	almost	absent	in	the	solar	system.	
The	model	is	falsifiable	on	many	levels.	With	the	foreseeable	progress	of	observation	
techniques,	it	will	be	possible	to	try	to	detect	at	the	center	of	the	Great	Repeller	
formation	the	presence	of	a	conglomerate	of	negative	mass,	which	would	then	reveal	its	
presence	by	a	significant	attenuation	of	the	magnitude	of	the	distant	sources.	If	this	
attenuation	reveals	the	presence	of	an	object	of	limited	size,	it	will	invalidate	any	
interpretation	in	terms	of	a	gap	in	the	dark	matter.		
The	cooling	time	of	a	protostar	increases	with	its	mass.	These	conglomerates,	which	
form	rapidly	after	decoupling,	can	be	compared	to	protostars	of	gigantic	mass	whose	
cooling	time	exceeds	the	age	of	the	universe.	They	are	thus	spheroidal	sets	made	up	of	
anti-hydrogen	 and	 anti-helium	 emitting	 negative	 energy	 photons,	 which	 our	
instruments	cannot	capture,	in	the	red	and	infrared	range.	In	this	world	of	negative	
masses,	there	is	no	atom	heavier	than	these.	There	are	no	stars,	no	galaxies,	no	planets.		
	
-  The	Janus	Model	provides	an	answer	to	the	question	of	the	lack	of	observation	of	
primordial	antimatter.		
	

Life	is	absent	from	it.	

	

36	
It	predicts	in	passing	that	antimatter	created	in	the	laboratory,	with	a	positive	
mass,	will	behave	like	ordinary	matter	in	experiments	to	demonstrate	its	
behavior	in	the	Earth's	gravitational	field	(Gbar	and	Alpha	experiments).	
	
It	is	the	only	one	to	attribute	a	precise	identity	to	the	invisible	components	of	the	
universe	and	to	specify	the	nature	of	the	objects	which	do	not	constitute	it.		
			
If	one	replaces	the	singularity	Big	Bang	by	a	bridge	connecting	the	two	folds	of	
universe	in	interaction,	which	are	in	a	way	the	Right	side	and	the	upside	down	
side	of	the	hypersurface	space-time,	the	model	brings	an	original	answer	to	the	
question	"what	was	there	before	the	Big	Bang?	»

Fig	.16	:	Elimination	of	the	initial	singularity	

	The	inversion	of	the	time	coordinate	is	not	a	problem	in	this	extension	of	general	
relativity	since	metrics,	field	equations,	for	all	equations	of	physics	are	time-reversible.	
What	does	Quantum	Mechanics	have	to	say	about	this?	If	we	refer	to	a	reference	work,	
that	of	S.	Weinberg	[26]	in	section	2.6	(pages	74	to	76).	We	will	find	two	arbitrary	
choices	concerning	the	operators	P	and	T	for	the	inversion	of	space	and	time.	In	order	to	
avoid	the	emergence	of	negative	energy	states,	which	are	considered	a	priori	impossible,	
the	following	two	arbitrary	choices	can	be	made,		
	
		15	–	Opening	of	a	new	research	field	in	Quantum	Mechanics	[6].		
	It	is	well	known	that	the	equations	of	relativistic	quantum	mechanics	(Klein-Gordon,	
Dirac)	naturally	highlight	negative	energy	states.	They	have	always	been	eliminated	by	
considering	that	they	lead	to	negative	probability	densities.	The	solution	that	physicists	

-  P	linear	and	and	unitary		(	LU	)	
	
-  T	antilinear	and	anti-unitary	(AA)

have	found	is	then	to	replace,	in	a	rather	artificial	way	it	must	be	admitted,	the	so-called	
probability	densities	by	charge	densities:	this	is	the	birth	of	antiparticles	(in	the	
commonly	accepted	sense).	
However,	if	we	look	a	little	closer	at	these	probability	densities,	we	see	that	they	can	be	
reinterpreted	as	real	probabilities,	positive,	if	we	consider	that	negative	energy	states	
are	also	associated	with	negative	masses.	This	is	particularly	striking	with	the	Klein-
Gordon	density,	which	involves	the	ratio	
(69)																																																																			
Probabilistic	interpretation	is	therefore	compatible	with	negative	energy	states	
provided	that	energies	and	mass	are	simultaneously	negative.	And	how	could	it	have	
been	otherwise	with	Einstein's	relation	at	rest	E	=m	c2	?	Thus	quantum	mechanics	is	the	
ideal	ground	for	reintegrating	negative	energies.	However,	the	consequences	must	be	
discerned.	One	of	them	is	that	the	temporal	reversal	operator	will	henceforth	be	
considered	as	a	linear	and	unitary	operator	[8].		
We	know,	in	fact,	that	a	symmetry	operator	must	necessarily	be	[26].			
-	Linear	and	unitary	(LU)	
or	
-	Anti-linear	and	anti-unitary	(AA)	
	
It	is	customary	to	choose,	for	a	spatial	inversion	P,	the	choice	LU	and	for	a	temporal	
inversion	T	the	choice	AA.	Thus,	the	action	of	these	discrete	symmetries	on	the	
fundamental	operators	of	quantum	mechanics	as	well	as	on	the	imaginary	i	can	be	
summarized	by:	
(70a)																																						   P: !x → − !x , !p ≡ −i"
∇ → − !p , i → i		
(70b)																																				   T: !x → !x , !p ≡ −i"
∇ → − !p , i → − i	
The	fundamental	relationship	of	quantum	mechanics:		
(71)																																																																				
⎤⎦ = i !δj k		
is	then	invariant	under	(70a)	as	well	as	under	(70b).		
Moreover,	the	symmetry	  PT( t → − t , i → − i )thus	chosen	ensures	the	invariance	of	the	
energies

Positive	energies,	if	we	limit	ourselves	to	them,	therefore	remain	exclusively	positive.	On	
the	contrary,	in	[8]	we	have	opted	for	the	choice	LU,	for	the	two	inversions,	which	leads	
to	the	following	result:

both	ensuring	the	invariance	of	(69).	The	major	difference	is	that	the	symmetry	PT	leads

There	is	nothing	to	prevent,	physically,	mathematically	and	from	a	probabilistic	point	of	
view,	to	consider	these	negative	energy	states	as	long	as	they	are	assigned	a	negative	
mass.		Moreover,	it	even	seems	that	this	additional	possibility	is	more	rigorous	if	we	
stick	to	mathematics,	since	implying	that	T	is	linear,	it	is	in	agreement	with	its	usual	
realization	(cf.	[26]	Eq	(2.3.16),	p.	58,	for	example):

		17)	Challenging	the	inflation	model.		
If	we	want	to	arrive	at	a	coherent	cosmological	model,	we	have	to	negotiate	all	the	
elements	coming	from	the	observations.	One	of	them	is	the	extreme	homogeneity	of	the	
CMB,	image	of	the	early	universe.	The	only	explanation	put	forward	so	far	is	the	
hypothesis	of	a	considerable	inflation,	attributed	to	a	field	of	inflatons.	As	no	alternative	
theory	was	presented,	this	model	ended	up	being	considered	as	part	of	a	"standard	
model",	whereas	no	credible	model	of	inflaton	was	born.		
Various	attempts	have	been	made	(&&&ref)	using	a	variable	speed	of	light.	But	these	
attempts	have	been	hampered	by	the	loss	of	Lorentz	invariance.	Moreover,	the	
observational	data	were	opposed	to	the	variation	of	c,	if	only	through	its	influence	on	
the	fine	structure	constant.		
Although	the	scientific	community	did	not	pay	attention	to	this	model,	as	early	as	1988,	
that	is	to	say	33	years	ago,	we	published	an	article	[27]		where	we	introduced	the	idea	of	
joint	variation	of	all	the	constants	of	physics,	in	agreement	with	the	correlative	variation	
of	space	and	time	gauges.		
	In	a	second	paper	[28]	an	attempt	was	made	to	deal	with	the	redshift	phenomenon	by	
trying	to	introduce	a	different	variation	of	the	electromagnetic	parameters.	But	later,	
years	later,	in	[12]	we	abandoned	this	idea	and	preferred	to	situate	this	phase	"with	
variable	constants",	as	part	of	the	radiative	era.				
	These	constants,	as	well	as	these	two	gauges,	are	present	in	the	equations	of	physics,	
remembering	:		
	

-	The	field	equation	
-	Maxwell’s	equations	

39	

	
-	Quantum	mechanics’	equations.		
The	quantities	to	consider	are:		
The	six	constants	of	physics:		
-	G	:	constant	of	gravitation	
-	c	:	speed	of	light	
-	h	:	Planck	constant	
-	e	:	elementary	electric	charge	
-	 µo	:	magnetic	permeability	of	vacuum		
-	m	:	all	kinds	of	masses	
We	suppose	all	masses	experience	the	same	gauge	variation.		
To	this	must	be	added		
-	a	:		space	scale	factor.		
-	t	:	time	scale	factor.			
We	must	therefore	consider	varying	these	eight	quantities	together:		
(74)																																													   G , c , h , e , µo , m , a , t
We	then	show		[12]		that	there	is	only	one	generalized	gauge	relation,	involving	these	
eight	quantities,	leaving	all	the	physics	equations	invariant.	The	details	of	the	
establishment	of	these	different	relations	can	be	found	in	the	appendix	III.	
In	these	conditions,	if	we	choose	one	of	these	quantities	as	a	variable,	the	other	seven	
are	deduced.	As	the	equations	of	physics	remain	invariant,	the	same	is	true	for	the	fine	
structure	constant.	Lorentz	invariance	is	also	assured.	It	is	convenient	to	take	the	scale	
factor	a,	related	to	the	expansion	process,	as	a	guiding	variable.	The	variations	are	then:		
(75)																					
; m ∝ a ; t ∝ a3/2		
Since	the	variables	 εo,	dielectric	constant	of	vacuum,	and	 µo	are	related,	we	deduce	that	
is	absolute	constant.	We	verify	that	the	invariance	of	the	Lorentz	metric		
	(76)																																															  ds2 = c2 dt 2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2		
according	to	the	above	relationships.		
As	recalled	in	the	appendix	III	these	gauge	relations	imply	that	:		
	-	All	characteristic	lengths	vary	as	a

-	All	characteristic	times	vary	as	t	
	-	All	energies	are	conserved.		
	
The	third	property	is	then	in	contradiction	with	redshift	measurements,	which	boil	
down	to	evaluate	the	energy	loss	of	photons,	due	to	the	expansion.	Thus	this	form	of	
"gauge"	evolution	can	only	be	located	during	the	radiative	era.		
	
What	is	the	observable,	related	to	this	mode	of	evolution	(of	gauge),	if	there	is	no	
redshift	?	Answer	:	it	is	the	evolution	of	the	cosmological	horizon.		
	(55)																																								
a		
	There	is	therefore	no	longer	any	need	for	inflation.		
	The	question	remains:	when	does	this	mechanism	arise?		
	The	"direct"	observational	data	are	those	of	the	redshift.	Beyond	that,	we	reconstruct	
the	situation	of	the	cosmos	through	a	model.	If	we	limit	the	redshift	to	the	first	
hundredth	of	a	second,	as	S.	Weinberg	did	in	his	book	"The	First	Three	Minuts",	this	
physics	seems	to	be	known	in	a	satisfactory	way.	The	first	confirmation	was	the	
discovery	of	the	primitive	radiation	background,	interpreted	as	resulting	from	an	
annihilation	between	pairs	of	particles	of	matter	and	antimatter.	Recalling	that	until	
now,	the	absence	of	observation	of	primordial	antimatter	could	not	be	explained.		
	
The	fact	that	"all	energies	are	conserved	in	the	phase	"with	variable	constants"	would	
oppose	a	number	of	phenomena,	such	as	deionization	or	others.	We	can	deduce	that	if	
this	mechanism	of	drift	of	constants	intervenes	it	could	be	before	this	first	hundredth	of	
a	second.		
	It	remains	quite	problematic	to	try	to	give	a	description	of	the	universe	by	going	further	
back	in	time.	We	only	know	that	the	density	took	extremely	high	values.	When	the	
temperature	exceeds	1012°	K	we	consider	that	the	universe	would	be	a	mixture	of	
quarks	in	free	state	and	gluons.	A	situation	that	we	try	to	reconstitute	in	colliders	using	
heavy	ions,	such	as	gold	or	lead.	If	the	theory	of	considering	baryons	and	mesons	as	
assemblies	of	quarks	has	proved	to	be	fruitful,	giving	rise	to	the	standard	model,	it	
remains	a	model,	insofar	as	it	has	not	been	possible	to	make	observations	of	quarks	in	
the	free	state.	On	the	other	hand,	attempts	to	describe	the	physical	content	of	higher	
energies,	through	the	theory	of	supersymmetry,	have	not	held	their	promises	
experimentally.	It	is	perhaps	more	realistic	to	admit	modestly	that	we	do	not	really	
know	what	happens	when	we	try	to	go	further	back	in	time.		
	When	we	try	to	create	a	model	of	a	neutron	star	we	come	across	problems	of	a	similar	
nature.	When	we	try	to	describe	the	contents	of	the	star,	as	we	go	deeper	into	its	entrails,	
we	are	led	to	consider	a	progressive	decomposition	of	the	matter	into	more	and	more	
fundamental	components.	At	the	surface	of	the	star:	iron	plasma,	totally	ionized.	Then,	
when	we	go	down,	the	nuclei	break	up	and	it	is	a	mixture	of	electrons	and	nucleons	in	
the	free	state.	Deeper	still,	it	is	the	electrons	that	combine	with	protons	to	give	neutrons.	

	
41	
Electrons	that	cease	to	"exist",	for	lack	of	space,	remembering	that	their	wave	function	
has	a	spatial	extension	1850	times	greater	than	that	of	neutrons	and	protons.	But	the	
medium	still	keeps	its	plasma	status,	as	long	as	the	electric	charges	of	the	protons	can	be	
neutralized	by	mesons,	whose	size	is	207	times	shorter	that	the	one	of	electrons.	Finally,	
when	it	is	the	mesons'	turn	to	run	out	of	space,	the	content	is	described	as	only	formed	
by	neutrons.	Finally,	when	the	density	increases	again,	theorists	propose	a	star	core	
constituted	by	a	plasma	of	quarks	and	gluons.	And	in	fact	this	descent	to	the	heart	of	
neutron	stars	is	a	way	to	go	back	in	the	past	of	the	universe.		
	
When	the	mass	of	the	neutron	star	increases	again,	the	model	proposed	by	the	theorist	
is	the	black	hole,	built	from	a	solution	of	the	field	equation	referring	to	a	portion	of	space	
free	of	any	content.		
		18)	The	question	of	time.		
	In	classical	chronology,	the	history	of	the	universe	is	attached	to	a	time	variable	t.	But	
what	is	its	physical	meaning?	How	to	conceive	a	clock,	on	a	simple	conceptual	level,	
when	the	different	components	are	animated	by	thermal	agitation	speeds	that	are	
significantly	close	to	the	speed	of	light.		
	One	can	envisage	a	kind	of	conceptual	clock	constituted	by	two	masses	orbiting	around	a	
common	center	of	gravity.	The	most	significant	way	to	talk	about	a	time	is	to	link	this	
measurement	to	an	angle.	It	is	the	rotation	of	the	second	hand	on	the	watch,	the	period	
of	rotation	of	the	Earth	around	the	Sun,	or	the	rotation	of	the	Milky	Way	on	itself.	The	
measure	of	time	will	thus	be	the	measure	of	a	number	of	revolutions	of	our	elementary	
clock,	by	supposing	that	this	one	manages	to	avoid	any	collision	with	its	surrounding	
medium,	made	up	of	increasingly	fast	particles.		
	
In	a	system	where	the	constants	do	not	vary,	this	is	the	case	for	the	masses	and	the	
constant	G	of	gravitation.	The	radius	of	gyration	of	the	system	and	the	period	of	rotation	
are	also	invariant.	In	these	conditions	our	elementary	clock	will	count	a	finite	number	of	
revolutions	if	we	go	back	to	a	situation	where	the	universe	is	assimilable	to	a	point.	This	
number	of	revolutions	is	then	identified	with	the	chosen	variable	t,	which	would	
constitute	a	good	chronological	indicator.		
	

Fig.	17		Horloge	élémentaire	

		It	is	completely	different	if	we	place	ourselves	in	a	gauge	context,	with	variable	
constants.	The	radius	of	gyration	varies	like	the	space	gauge	a.	The	gravitational	
constant	varies	as	the	inverse	of	a	while	the	masses	vary	as	a.	The	calculation	of	the

period	of	the	system	shows	that	it	varies	like	the	time	gauge	t,	i.e.	it	is	shorter	and	
shorter	as	we	go	back	in	time.	The	number	of	revolutions	made	by	our	clock	is:		
	(56)																																													
	Thus,	from	the	state,	the	moment	when	the	spatial	extension	of	the	universe	will	be	null	
until	today	our	clock	would	total	an	infinite	number	of	turns.	Conversely,	to	go	back	to	a	
hypothetical	instant	zero,	in	this	mode	of	cosmic	evolution,	evokes	the	aphorism	of	Zeno	
according	to	which	Achilles,	pursuing	a	tortoise,	never	manages	to	catch	up	with	it.

The	extreme	homogeneity	of	the	CMB	has	led	to	the	proposal	of	the	existence	of	a	
fantastic	inflation,	without	any	other	justification	than	this	single	observational	data.	
The	model	including	a	"variable	constant"	step,	described	by	a	gauge	process,	leads	to	a	
variable	c	evolution	where	the	cosmological	horizon	follows	the	variation	of	the	space	
scale	factor,	which	is	another	way	to	justify	this	great	homogeneity.	But	the	question	to	
be	answered	is:		
	-	What	causes	this	regime	change?		
	In	classical	cosmology,	and	in	the	phase	of	the	Janus	model	that	follows	the	decoupling,	
the	masses	in	the	universe	do	not	expand.	It	is	the	photons	that	expand	and	their	
wavelength	then	follows	the	growth	of	the	space	scale	factor	a.		
	
We	have	seen,	when	we	went	inside	a	neutron	star,	how	its	content	tended	to	simplify.	
At	the	center	of	the	star:	neutrons.	In	order	for	them	to	exist,	they	must	be	able	to	install	
their	wave	function	in	the	disposable	space.	The	order	of	magnitude	of	the	minimal	
space	required	can	be	the	Comton	length	of	neutrons	which	is	of	the	order	of	10-15	
meters.	What	happens	when	the	density	of	the	medium	is	such	that	the	average	distance	
between	neutrons	becomes	smaller	than	this	length?	There	is	no	clear	answer	to	this	
question.		
	The	same	question	can	be	asked	when	we	try	to	retrace	the	course	of	events	in	the	
universe.	If	we	draw	a	parallel	with	the	neutron	star	model,	we	would	be	led	to	consider	
a	medium	made	up	of	neutrons	and	antineutrons,	which	are	more	and	more	closely	
packed	together.	A	critical	moment	would	then	occur,	resulting	in	the	transition	to	a	
regime	of	variable	constants,	where	the	Compton	length	of	the	neutrons	ceases	to	be	
constant	and	varies	as	the	space	scale	factor	a.	But	this	is	only	a	conjecture.	However,	it	
is	not	more	problematic	than	the	scheme	proposed	by	the	inflation	theory.	We	can	
represent	on	the	figure	below	the	way	in	which	the	different	constants	evolve.	On	the	x-
axis,	in	logarithmic	coordinates,	a	parameter	of	evolution	such	as	time,	the	unit	value	
corresponds	to	the	transition	between	the	two	regimes.	After	this	time,	the	constants	
adopt	the	values	that	we	know	today.	If	we	calculate	the	Planck	length,	we	notice	that	it	
also	follows	the	evolution	of	the	space	scale	factor,	while	the	Planck	time	follows	that	of	
the	time	scale	factor.

	21)	An	alternative	interpretation	of	CMB	fluctuations.	
In	the	field	equations,	the	energy-matter	content	in	the	form	of	radiation	contributes	to	
the	field,	as	does	matter.		In	radiative	eras	these	contents	are	in	the	majority.		
It	is	quite	legitimate	to	ask	whether	a	form	of	gravitational	instability	could	occur	in	this	
radiation-dominated	medium,	in	a	gas	of	photons.		Let	us	suppose	that	somewhere	in	
the	universe	there	is	a	region	of	characteristic	dimension	L	where	the	content	is	greater	
than	what	is	around	it.	If	nothing	happens,	we	can	consider	that	this	overdensity	of	
radiation	will	dissipate	in	a	time	L/c.		
If	we	abandon	a	lump	of	material	of	diameter	L	to	the	only	forces	of	gravity	it	will	
implode	according	to	a	law	  L ∝ t3/2	or,	put	differently,	this	will	occur	with	a	
characteristic	accretion	time	 tJ ∝ L2/3.	By	introducing	the	conservation	of	mass	  ρm ∝ L −3	
−1/2.		
we	obtain	an	implosion	time	(or	Jeans	time)	  tJ ∝ ρm
If	now	it	is	a	question	of	an	overdensity	of	radiation	this	one	will	create	a	gravitational	
field.	The	evolution	of	such	a	cluster	will	be	according	to	 L ∝ t1/2.	But	as	we	have	then	
−1/2.	This	overdensity	will	increase	if	the	
  ρr ∝ L −4	we	will	have	an	implosion	time	  tJ ∝ ρr

> tJ	;	In	other	words,	the	
dispersion	time	is	greater	than	the	accretion	time,	i.e.	i	
gravitational	instability	will	occur	on	distance	scales	greater	than	
(61)																																																																										 LJ = ctJ	
We	find	then,	in	this	mechanism	of	a	gravitational	instability	of	the	photon	gas,	the	
equivalent	of	the	Jeans	length	of	the	matter.	But	this	one	is	then	of	the	order	of	the	
cosmological	horizon.	This	is	the	reason	why	we	have	never	been	concerned	with	a	
phenomenon	which	would	then	be	fundamentally	unobservable,	although	it	creates	
fluctuations	whose	order	of	magnitude	of	the	wavelength	is	the	Jeans	length	in	the	
radiative	medium.		
These	fluctuations	being	able	to	occur	during	the	phases	of	evolution	with	variable	
constants,	in	the	two	populations,	of	positive	or	negative	energy,	they	are	not	only	
translated	by	a	fluctuation	of	but	would	also	affect	the	values	of	the	constants,	with	two	
fields	translating	variations	of	the	sets:		
(62)																																				   G (+) , c(+) , h(+) , e(+) , µo
}	
linked	by		
(63)			
a(+) ; m(+) ∝ a(+) ; t(+) ∝ a(+)3/2	
and	:		
(64)																																				   G (−) , c(−) , h(−) , e(−) , µo
}	
linked	by		
	(65)			
a(+) ; m(+) ∝ a(+) ; t(+) ∝ a(+)3/2	
We	thus	see	the	idea	of	a	multiverse,	made	up	of	"universe	bubbles"	forming	a	pavement,	
endowed	with	their	own	set	of	constants,	with	the	corresponding	values	of	the	scaling	
factors.	But,	unlike	what	others	envisage,	the	equations	would	remain	the	same	from	
one	cell	to	another	and,	in	fact,	their	histories	would	not	be	fundamentally	different.	All	
cells	of	negative	energy	would	give	rise,	in	their	dominated	matter	era,	to	a	regular	
distribution	of	spheroidal	clusters.	In	the	positive	energy	cells	we	would	find	lacunar	
structures,	giving	birth	to	galaxies	and	stars.		
But	in	these	sets	a	difference	of	their:	 a(+) >> a(−)	.	As	the	Jeans	lengths	are	such	that			
(−) ! a(−)		the	spatial	distributions	of	the	fluctuations	are	very	different	
in	the	two	populations.	If	the	negative	medium	keeps	a	total	homogeneity	during	its	
radiative	phase,	the	fluctuations	of	density	of	its	radiation	cause	a	weak	response	in	the	
positive	world.

And	therein	lies,	in	our	opinion,	the	origin	of	the	fluctuations	of	the	CMB.	Their	analysis,	
by	identifying	the	fundamental	fluctuation,	which	is	of	the	order	of	one	degree,	gives	us	
access	to	the	relationship:

of	the	universe,	according	to	which	it	is	the	spheroidal	clusters	of	negative	mass	which	
are	formed	first.		
As	the	thermal	agitation	viotesses	follow	the	gauge	process	:			,	for	numerical	simulations	
of	the	formation	of	this	very	grade	scale	structure	we	have	the	data:

	22)	The	problem	of	interstellar	travel.	
The	nearest	planetary	system,	linked	to	the	nearest	stars,	is	four	light	years	away.	This	
fact	made	that	until	now	it	was	considered	that	the	idea	of	being	able	one	day	to	realize	
trips	towards	these	close	systems	would	be	unthinkable	at	the	scale	of	a	human	vacuum.	
But	the	new	geometric	context	changes	things.	The	universe	is	a	variety	equipped	with	
two	different	metrics.	All	the	points	of	the	variety	are	located	with	the	help	of	
dimensionless	dcoordinates:

Thus	interstellar	travel	becomes	non-impossible.	

	
47	
The	distance	between	these	two	points	will	be	different	depending	on	whether	it	is	
covered	in	the	positive	or	negative	mass	sector:		
(68)																									  L(+) =a(+)(ξB
1 )	
If	a	vehicle	had	a	technology	allowing	it	to	reverse	its	mass	(and	that	of	its	passengers)	
the	distance	it	would	have	to	cover	would	be	a	hundred	times	shorter.	Moreover	the	
speed	limit,	at	that	of	the	light	in	the	negative	sector,	would	be	raised	of	a	factor	ten.	
From	where	a	priori	a	weaker	travel	time	of	three	orders	of	magnitude.		
Once	arrived	at	its	destination,	the	vehicle	would	only	have	to	operate	a	new	mass	
inversion	to	find	itself	in	the	positive	sector.	During	its	journey,	the	passengers	of	this	
vehicle	would	lose	all	possibility	of	having	observations	of	the	positive	mass	
environment,	always	present	but	now	invisible	to	it.	Inversely,	they	would	be	the	
spectators	of	the	negative	world	scenery,	that	is	to	say,	they	would	be	able	to	see	the	
spheroidal	clusters	of	negative	mass,	emitting	in	the	red	and	the	infrared.		
At	the	moment	of	the	mass	inversion	two	equivalent	volumes,	positive	and	negative	
sectors	would	be	exchanged.	If	the	vehicle	performs	its	mass	inversion	when	it	is	in	the	
atmosphere,	it	will	no	longer	be	visible	to	observers	made	up	of	positive	mass	and	will	
seem	to	dematerialize	in	their	eyes.		
As	the	negative	sector,	in	the	solar	system,	is	ultra	rarefied,	the	content	of	the	equivalent	
volume	which	will	take	the	place	of	the	one	occupied	by	the	vehicle	will	be	filled	with	
photons	and	very	rare	atoms	of	anti-hydrogen	and	anti-helium	whose	masses,	having	
also	undergone	an	inversion,	became	positive	and	will	annihilate	in	contact	with	the	
atoms	and	molecules	of	the	atmosphere,	by	producing	gamma	rays.	The	irruption	of	the	
air	molecules	in	a	space	perceived	as	quasi	empty	will	produce	a	disturbance	of	
aerodynamic	nature.		
This	process	of	mass	inversion	is	equivalent	to	swapping	adjacent	contents	located	on	
the	front	and	back	of	the	hypersurface.	It	is	thus	a	problem	of	topology.	For	there	to	be	
historical	continuity	it	is	necessary	that	the	vehicle	and	its	passengers	follow	a	
continuous	line	of	universe,	continuing	their	progression	towards	the	future.	The	fact	of	
momentarily	moving	in	the	negative	sector	does	not	mean	that	the	passengers	would	
see	their	own	time	reversed,	that	is	to	say	that	they	would	not	reappear	in	their	own	
past.	This	path	would	make	them	cross	on	their	way	the	small	quantity	of	antimatter	
present	in	the	negative	sector,	endowed	then	with	the	same	sign	of	the	mass.	Of	which	
the	vehicle	and	this	antimatter	could	interact.	But	the	vehicle	could	then	protect	itself	
from	this	flow	of	antimatter,	comparable	to	the	solaore	wind	emitted	by	the	sun,	from	
which	the	Earth	protects	itself	with	the	shield	constituted	by	its	magnetic	field.		
	23)	The	problem	of	swapping	volumes	between	adjacent	sectors.		
A	first	scheme	of	mass	inversion	has	been	evoked	in	the	article	[29],	through	a	
reinterpretation	of	the	Schwarzschild	solution	of	the	Einstein	equation.	
	

	
48	
	According	to	the	scheme	of	special	relativity	the	energy	equivalent	to	a	mass	M	is	Mc2.	If	
the	amount	of	energy	needed	to	invert	this	mass	was	of	this	order,	this	technology	
would	be	problematic.	We	are	faced	with	the	problem	of	swapping	two	adjacent	
volumes	of	4D	hypersurfaces.	It	is	convenient	to	consider	the	positive	and	negative	
sectors	as	a	kind	of	"parallel	universe".	But	the	picture	is	immediately	misleading	
because	one	can	hardly	take	into	account	the	considerable	difference	between	scale	
factors	a(+)	and	a(-).	If	we	disregard	this,	we	can	give	a	2D	image	of	these	two	folds	by	
simply	representing	them	by	two	parallel	planes.	

Fig.19	:	Before	surgery	

The	alteration	that	we	consider	to	give	to	these	two	folds	is	a	local	variation	of	the	
curvature,	equivalent	to	a	local	concentration	of	energy.	We	will	present	a	solution	
referring	to	a	2D	toy	model,	where	the	permutation	of	two	adjacent	domains,	whose	
borders	are	cerce,	is	operated	by	an	operation	described	in	topoogy	by	the	word	surgery.		
A	technological	device	causes	a	concentration	of	positive	energy,	in	the	positive	sector,	
in	the	external	vicinity	of	the	wall.	This	is	shown	in	this	sequence	of	didactic	images,	by	a	
kind	of	groove.	We	then	split	the	object	by	presenting	only	half	of	it	in	order	to	perceive	
the	curvature	given	to	the	surfaces.	We	suppose	that	the	alteration	of	the	curvature,	in	
the	upper	fold,	supposed	to	translate	a	concentration	of	energy,	would	cause	a	
"curvature	induced"	in	the	adjacent	fold.

Fig.21	:	The	surgery	occurs	along	a	circle	
	The	geometrical	operation	of	surgery	involves	the	creation	of	an	infinite	curvature	along	
a	circle.	In	the	field	of	physics	this	could	be	a	very	pronounced	curvature,	associated	
with	a	very	high	local	density	of	energy.	It	is	necessary	to	understand	that	when	this	one	
is	operated	the	adjacent	parts	of	folds	1	and	2	have	been	exchanged.

	This	is	equivalent	to	:

	To	illustrate	the	suggested	scheme	we	represent	the	reduction	of	the	grey	portion:	

Fig	23	:	After	surgery	

	
Fig	24	:	disappearance	of	the	portion	from	fold	2	
	This	is	only	a	toy	model.	This	said,	techniques	to	concentrate	energy	in	a	region	of	space	
forming	a	thin	layer	can	be	envisaged,	for	example	by	imparting	energy	to	nuclei	
possessing	a	long-lived	metastable	excitation	level,	as	we	know	they	exist..		
	24)	–	Conclusion	
This	work	suggests	a	complete	upheaval	of	cosmology,	as	well	as	an	extension	of	
theoretical	physics	to	the	field	of	negative	energies.	It	is	a	real	paradigm	shift.	As	it	
stands,	the	negative	mass	model	provides	a	credible	cosmological	alternative	and	
quantum	mechanical	framework	to	dark	energy/dark	mass	conjectures.	For	such	a	
model	to	impose	itself,	it	is	not	enough	to	propose	alternative	interpretations	to	those	
attributed	to	dark	matter	and	dark	energy.	It	will	have	to	provide	answers	to	all	the	
questions	in	order	to	be	able	to	pose	as	a	challenger	of	the	ΛCDM	model,	a	standard	
model	that	we	should	call	i-ΛCDM	insofar	as	this	last	implies	an	additional	hypothesis,	
that	of	the	existence	of	a	field	of	inflatons,	responsible	for	the	phenomenon	of	cosmic	
inflation,	a	hypothesis	whose	only	merit	is	to	justify	the	extreme	homogeneity	of	the	
primitive	universe.	If	it	does	not	resort	to	this	phenomenon	of	cosmic	inflation,	the	new	

	
51	
model	will	therefore	have	to	produce	something	that	alternatively	accounts	for	this	
homogeneity.	In	addition,	it	will	have	to	provide	its	own	model	of	the	fluctuations	of	the	
CMB.	Finally,	it	will	have	to	provide	the	reason	why,	at	the	end	of	its	radiative	phase,	
these	two	sets	of	masses,	positive	and	negative,	obey	the	same	equations,	equipped	with	
different	sets	of	constants..		
The	answers	to	these	questions	will	be	outlined	in	the	following	article.

We	know	that	we	can	perform	a	circular	permutation	in	the	trace:

The	term

Equations	(t),(u),(v)	represent	an	extension	of	equations	13.107	of	reference	[27].	The	
relation	(v)	makes	it	possible	to	find	Souriau's	relation	([27]	page	190,	equations	14.67	).	
The	inversion	of	time	 ( λ= −1)	leads	to	the	inversion	of	energy	and	of	the	impulse	
vector	  
!p	.	The	matrix	M	depending	on	six	parameters	can	be	decomposed	into	two	
vectors.	The	vector	f	is	what	Souriau	calls	the	passage	and	s	is	the	spin.	
	(x)
																																														 
The	passage	f	is	not	an	intrinsic	attribute	of	the	motion	because	it	can	be	cancelled	by	a	
change	of	variable	accompanying	the	particle.	Only	the	spin	remains,	of	which	Souriau	
demonstrated	in	1970	its	geometrical	nature.	By	cancelling	the	spatio-temporal	
translation	C	the	relation	(u),	where	λ		does	not	appear,	shows	that	the	inversion	of	
time	does	not	modify	the	spin	vector.	With	this	way	of	carrying	out	the	calculation	one	
obtains	the	result	of	the	action	of	the	group	on	a	movement,	characterized	by	the	
quantities	
}.	It	is	the	relation	(t)	which	
}gives	another	movement	
informs	on	the	fact	that	starting	from	a	motion	representing	that	of	a	particle	of	matter	:		
-	 ( λ= −1; µ= 1)results	in	a	PT-symmetry	plus	a	C-symmetry	.	One	thus	obtains	the	
movement	of	a	particle	of	negative	mass.		
-	  ( λ= 1; µ= −1)operates	a	C-symmetry.	The	movement	obtained	is	that	of	an	
antiparticle	in	the	sense	of	Dirac,	of	positive	mass.		
-	 ( λ− = 1; µ= −1)represents	a	PT-symmetry.	The	motion	is	that	of	an	antiparticle	of	
negative	mass	(antiparticle	in	the	sense	of	Feynmann).
