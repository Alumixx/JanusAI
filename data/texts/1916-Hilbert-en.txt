Corresponding reasoning applies to the light clock. |
The axiomatic construction of our pseudo-geometry could be carried out without
difﬁculty: ﬁrst an axiom should be established from which it follows that length resp.
proper time must be integrals whose integrand is only a function of the 
 and their
ﬁrst derivatives with respect to the parameter; suitable for such an axiom would be
the property of development of the thread or the well-known envelope theorem for
geodesic lines. Secondly an axiom is needed whereby the theorems of the pseudo-
Euclidean geometry, that is the old principle of relativity, shall be valid in inﬁnitesi-

mal regions; for this the axiom put down by W. Blaschke2 would be particularly suit-
able,  which  states  that  the  condition  of  orthogonality  for  any  two  directions—
segments or time lines—shall always be a symmetric relation.

Let us brieﬂy summarize the main facts that the Monge-Hamilton theory of differ-

ential equations teaches us for our pseudo-geometry.

xs,

Up to now all coordinate systems 

 that result from any one by arbitrary trans-
formation have been regarded as equally valid. This arbitrariness must be restricted
when we want to realize the concept that two world points on the same time line can
be related as cause and effect, and that it should then no longer be possible to trans-
form such world points to be simultaneous. In declaring 
 as the true time coordi-
nate we adopt the following deﬁnition:

A true spacetime coordinate system is one for which the following four inequali-

ties hold, in addition to

(31)

A transformation that transforms one such spacetime coordinate system into another
true spacetime coordinate system shall be called a true spacetime coordinate transfor-
mation.

The four inequalities mean that at any world point

 the associated null cone

the latter line is therefore always a time line. |

Let any time line

it follows that in a true spacetime coordinate system we must always have

and therefore that along a time line the true time coordinate 
 must always increase
resp. decrease. Because a time line remains a time line upon every coordinate trans-
formation,  therefore  two  world  points  along  one  time  line  can  never  be  given  the
same value of the time coordinate 
 through a true spacetime transformation; that
is, they cannot be transformed to be simultaneous.

On the other hand, if the points of a curve can be truly transformed to be simulta-

and here the right side is positive because of the ﬁrst three of our inequalities (31); the
curve therefore characterizes a segment.

So we see that the concepts of cause and effect, which underlie the principle of
causality, also do not lead to any inner contradictions whatever in the new physics, if
we only take the inequalities (31) always to be part of our basic equations, that is if
we conﬁne ourselves to using true spacetime coordinates.

At this point let us take note of a special spacetime coordinate system that will
later be useful and which I will call the Gaussian coordinate system, because it is the
generalization of the system of geodesic polar coordinates introduced by Gauss in the
theory of surfaces. In our four-dimensional world let any three-dimensional space be
given so that every curve conﬁned to that space is a segment: a space of segments, as
I would like to call it; | let 
 be any point coordinates of this space. We now

this also applies to the fourth, the Gaussian coordinate system always turns out to be
a true spacetime coordinate system.

We now return to the investigation of the principle of causality in physics. As its
main contents we consider the fact, valid so far in every physical theory, that from a
knowledge  of  the  physical  quantities  and  their  time  derivatives  in  the  present  the
future  values  of  these  quantities  can  always  be  determined:  without  exception  the
laws of physics to date have been expressed in a system of differential equations in
which the number of the functions occurring in them was essentially the same as the
number  of  independent  differential  equations;  and  thus  the  well-known  general
Cauchy theorem on the existence of integrals of partial differential equations directly
offered the rationale of proof for the above fact.

Now, as I emphasized particularly in my ﬁrst communication, the basic equations
of physics (4) and (5) established there are by no means of the type characterized

THE FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS (SECOND COMMUNICATION)

above; rather, according to Theorem I, four of them are a consequence of the rest: we
regarded the four Maxwell equations (5) as a consequence of the ten gravitational
equations (4), and so we have for the 14 potentials 
 only 10 equations (4) that
are essentially independent of each other. |

As soon as we maintain the demand of general invariance for the basic equations
of physics the circumstance just mentioned is essential and even necessary. Because
if there were further invariant equations, independent of (4), for the 14 potentials,
then introduction of a Gaussian coordinate system would lead for the 10 physical
quantities as per (33),

to a system of equations that would again be mutually independent, and mutually
contradictory, because there are more than 10 of them.

Under such circumstances then, as occur in the new physics of general relativity,
it  is  by  no  means  any  longer  possible  from  knowledge  of  physical  quantities  in
present and past to derive uniquely their future values. To show this intuitively on an
example, let our basic equations (4) and (5) of the ﬁrst communication be integrated
in the special case corresponding to the presence of a single electron permanently at
rest, so that the 14 potentials

ativity principle we must demand invariance not only for the general laws of physics,
but we must accord invariance to each separate statement in physics that is to have
physical meaning—in accordance with this, that in the ﬁnal analysis it must be possi-
ble to establish each physical fact by thread or light clock, that is, instruments of
 character. In the theory of curves and surfaces, where a statement in a cho-
invariant
sen parametrization of the curve or surface has no geometrical meaning for the curve
or surface itself, if this statement does not remain invariant under any arbitrary trans-
formation of the parameters or cannot be brought to invariant form; so also in physics
we must characterize a statement that does not remain invariant under any arbitrary
transformation of the coordinate system as physically meaningless. For example, in
the case considered above of the electron at rest, the statement that, say at the time
 this electron is at rest, has no physical meaning because this statement is not
x4
invariant.

Concerning the principle of causality, let the physical quantities and their time
derivatives be known at the present in some given coordinate system: then a state-
ment will only have physical meaning if it is invariant under all those transforma-
tions,  for  which  the  coordinates  just  used  for  the  present  remain  unchanged;  I
maintain that statements of this type for the future are all uniquely determined, that
is, the principle of causality holds in this form:

From  present  knowledge  of  the  14  physical  potentials 

  all  statements
about them for the future follow necessarily and uniquely provided they are physi-
cally meaningful.

To  prove  this  proposition  we  use  the  Gaussian  spacetime  coordinate  system.

First. This  can  be  done  by  means  of  an  invariant  coordinate  system.  Like  the
Gaussian system used above one can apply the well-known Riemannian one, as well
as that spacetime coordinate system in which electricity appears at rest with unit cur-

there may be special invariant coordinate systems; for example, in the case treated

Second. The statement, according to which a coordinate system can be found in
which the 14 potentials 
 have certain deﬁnite values in the future, or fulﬁll
certain deﬁnite conditions, is always an invariant and therefore a physically meaning-
ful one. The mathematically invariant expression for | such a statement is obtained by
eliminating the coordinates from those relations. The case considered above, of the
electron at rest, provides an example: the essential and physically meaningful content
of the causality principle is here expressed by the statement that the electron which is
at rest for the time 
 will, for a suitably chosen spacetime coordinate system,
also remain at rest in all its parts for the future 

Third. A statement is also invariant and thus has physical meaning if it is sup-
posed to be valid in any arbitrary coordinate system. An example of this are Ein-
stein’s  energy-momentum  equations  having  divergence  character.  For,  although
Einstein’s energy does not have the property of invariance, and the differential equa-
tions he put down for its components are by no means covariant as a system of equa-
tions, nevertheless the assertion contained in them, that they shall be satisﬁed in any
coordinate system, is an invariant demand and therefore it carries physical meaning.
According  to  my  exposition,  physics  is  a  four-dimensional  pseudo-geometry,
whose metric 
 is connected to the electromagnetic quantities, i.e. to the matter, by
the basic equations (4) and (5) of my ﬁrst communication. With this understanding,
an old geometrical question becomes ripe for solution, namely whether and in what
sense Euclidean geometry—about which we know from mathematics only that it is a
logical structure free from contradictions—also possesses validity in the real world.
The  old  physics  with  the  concept  of  absolute  time  took  over  the  theorems  of
Euclidean geometry and without question put them at the basis of every physical the-
ory. Gauss as well proceeded hardly differently: he constructed a hypothetical non-

Euclidean physics, by maintaining the absolute time and revoking only the parallel
axiom from the propositions of Euclidean geometry; a measurement of the angles of a
triangle of large dimensions showed him the invalidity of this non-Euclidean physics.
The new physics of Einstein’s principle of general relativity takes a totally differ-
ent  position  vis-à-vis  geometry.  It  takes  neither  Euclid’s  nor  any  other  particular
geometry a priori as basic, in order to deduce from it the proper laws of physics, but,
as I showed in my ﬁrst communication, | the new physics provides at one fell swoop
through one and the same Hamilton’s principle the geometrical and the physical laws,
namely the basic equations (4) and (5), which tell us how the metric  —at the
same time the mathematical expression of the phenomenon of gravitation—is con-
nected with the values 

 of the electrodynamic potentials.

Euclidean geometry is an action-at-a-distance law foreign to the modern physics:
By revoking the Euclidean geometry as a general presupposition of physics, the the-
ory of relativity maintains instead that geometry and physics have identical character
and are based as one science on a common foundation.

The geometrical question mentioned above amounts to the investigation, whether

approach constants at inﬁnity, it follows that these must be constant in general, that
is: By varying the metric of the pseudo-Euclidean geometry under the assumptions I

the metric is not regular. Here I call a metric or gravitational ﬁeld 
 regular at
some place if it is possible to introduce by transformation with unique inverse a coor-
dinate system for which the corresponding functions 
 at that place are regular,
that is they are continuous and arbitrarily differentiable at the place and its neighbor-
hood, and have a determinant 

 that differs from zero.

Although in my view only regular solutions of the basic physical equations repre-
sent reality directly, still it is precisely the solutions with places of non-regularity that
are  an  important  mathematical  instrument  for  approximating  characteristic  regular
solutions—and in this sense, following Einstein and Schwarzschild, the metric (45),
not regular at 
 is to be viewed as the expression for | gravity of a
centrally symmetric mass distribution in the neighborhood of the origin7. In the same
sense a point mass is to be understood as the limit of a certain distribution of electric-
ity about one point, but I refrain at this place from deriving its equations of motion
from my basic physical equations. A similar situation prevails for the question about
the differential equations for the propagation of light.

The motion of a point mass in a gravitational ﬁeld is described by a geodesic line,

which is a time line8.

The motion of light in a gravitational ﬁeld is described by a geodesic null line.
Because the world line representing the motion of a point mass shall be a time
line, it is easily seen to be always possible to bring the point mass to rest by true
spacetime  transformations,  i.e.  there  are  true  spacetime  coordinate  systems  with
respect to which the point mass remains at rest.

The differential equations of geodesic lines for the centrally symmetric gravita-

tional ﬁeld (45) arise from the variational problem

On the other hand, the upper limit 

 found in (61) for the speed of a mass
point on a circular orbit also has a simple interpretation. According to the axiom for
light propagation this propagation is represented by a null geodesic. Accordingly if
