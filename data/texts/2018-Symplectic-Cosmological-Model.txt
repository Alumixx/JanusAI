In this paper, we use the Lie algebra of the dual Poincar´e dynamical group which when
acted upon by its coadjoint, displays energy momentum and spin as pure geometrical
quantities. When extended to the full group, one obtains negative mass species in ac-
cordance with our Janus Cosmological Model and the twin universe model conjectured
by A. Sakharov. Within a 5D Kaluza space, the theory leads to a new matter/antimatter
duality implying negative energy photons emitted on the negative domain of this twin
Universe. This accounts for the dark matter and dark energy which are thereof impos-
sibe to detect in our domain. Finally, we show that shifting to a Hermitean space-time
with an associated complex dynamic group yields imaginary energy, imaginary energy
and imaginary charges all embedded in a symplectic (complex) framework which re-
mains open to wide investigations.

Introduction
Symplectic geometry relies on symplectic manifolds. Those
are said symplectic when they are endowed with a so-called
symplectic form that allows for the measurement of sizes of 2-
dimensional objects. In Riemannian geometry, the metric ten-
sor probes lengths and angles, whereas the symplectic form
measures areas.

The term symplectic was ﬁrst coined by H. Weyl in 1939
as a substitute to rather confusing (line) complex groups and/
or Abelian linear groups. The relativistic symplectic mechan-
ics [1] was primarly developed by the french mathematician
J. M. Souriau from dynamic groups theory. It provides a new
description of energy, momentum and spin only in terms of
pure geometrical quantities. This arises from two objects: n-
dimensional space and its isometry group.

In what follows, we brieﬂy describe its properties which
we apply to a particular cosmological model featuring two
types of masses and energies comparable to the twin Universe
originally conjectured by A. Zakharov.

1 The Janus Cosmological Model (JCM)
The main mathematical tool used here is the so-called “mo-
mentum map” which is inferred from the co-adjoint action of
the group on the dual of its Lie algebra. (The coadjoint of the
Lie group is the dual of the adjoint representation.) Applying
the technique of this coadjoint action leads to the appearance
of generalized linear and angular momenta: {energy E, 3-
momentum p, spin s}. The action of the group corresponds
to

M(cid:48) = L M TM + N TP TL − L P TN,

P(cid:48) = L P,

L is here the element of the Lorentz group and N is the boost
4-vector. In the classical treatment, one merely considers the
restricted Poincar´e Group which is formed with orthochron-
ous components L0. Hence, the full Poincar´e Group can be
written as

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

with λ = ±1.

We then obtain two kinds of matters an two kinds of pho-
tons with each an opposite mass and energy. This copes with
the Janus Cosmological Model (JCM) we developed earlier
[2–4]. Such a model involves particles with opposite masses
and energy. However, as shown by H. Bondi [5], the ﬁeld
equations cannot sustain this duality due to the subsequent
and unmanageable “run away” eﬀect. In short, General Rel-
ativity deals with positive masses that are attractive, while
negative masses would exhibit repelling forces. Therefore, if
one considers a couple (+m, −m), the negative mass escapes
and is “chased” by the positive one while at the same time
experiencing a uniform acceleration.

This issue can be evaded by considering a bi-metric (our
JCModel) within a single manifold M4 equipped with two
metric tensors (+)gµν and (−)gµν, which deﬁne two ﬁeld equa-
tions [5]:

2 Extension to a wider geometrical framework
We now turn consider an extension of the group to a ﬁve di-
mensional scheme so as to obtain an isometry group which
acts on the basic Kaluza space-time

By extending to the ﬁfth dimension, the Noether theorem
induces an additional conserved scalar quantity which is read-
ily identiﬁed with the electric charge q.
The µ = −1 implies both the inversion of this charge and
the inversion of the ﬁfth dimension, which is just the geomet-
rical expression of the matter-antimatter duality as primarly
shown by J. M. Souriau [6]. Therefore the physics ruled by
the dynamical group (7) exhibits straightforwardly the matter-
antimatter symmetry in the two domains with opposed mass
and energy. If we now add p-Kaluza-like dimensions, we ob-
tain the metric under the form:

The electric charge is just one of the quantum charges.
Here again, the (µ = −1) terms reﬂect the C-symmetry: they
account for the classical matter-antimatter representation.
The (µ = −1; λ = −1) correspond to the PT-symmetry clas-
sically associated with the “Feynman antimatter” which is no
longer indentiﬁed with the “C-antimatter”. This is due to the
presence of the time reversal T inducing both the mass and
energy inversion.
In other words, the group representation
(9) which is the basis of the JC Model, provides two distinct
types of antimatters:

— The C-type corresponding to Dirac’s antimatter.
— The PT-type corresponding to Feynman’s antimatter.

Sakharov suggested that the Universe comprises two dom-
ains:
the actual Universe and its twin Universe, each con-
nected through a singularity [8–10]. Both are CPT-symmet-
rical. Since the mass inversion goes with T-symmetry, our
JC Model [3,4] corresponds to such CPT-symmetry. The so-
called twin matter becomes nothing but a copy of ordinary
particles with opposite masses and charges. If, as suggested
by Sakharov, positive masses are synthetized by positive en-
ergy quarks faster than the synthesis of negative masses from
positive energy antiquarks, then in the positive energy domain
we ﬁnd:

— Remnant positive masses matter.
— The equivalent (ratio 3/1) of positive energy antiquarks.
— Positive energy photons.
In analogy to Sakharov’s ideas, the negative energy do-

main would be thus composed of:

— Remnant negative masses matter.
— The equivalent (ratio 3/1) of negative energy quarks.
— Negative energy photons.
As shown in [3,4], the negative material suitably replaces
both dark matter and so-called dark energy. Accordingly,
by emitting negative energy photons, the remnant negative
masses matter are genuinely invisible.

4 Remark about the Quantum Theory of Fields (QFT)
In QFT the time reversal operator is a complex operator which
can be linear and unitary, as well as antilinear and anti-unita-
ry. If chosen linear and unitary, this operator implies the exis-
tence of negative energy states, which are `a priori banned by
QFT. In Weinberg [7], we quote: “In order to avoid this dis-
astrous conclusion, we are forced to conclude that T is anti-
linear and anti-unitary”. On page 104, Weinberg also writes:
“no examples are known of particles that furnish unconven-
tional representation of inversions, so these possibilities will
not be pursued further here”. Actually, this was true until
the discovery of the acceleration of the expanding universe
which implies the action of a negative pressure. As a pres-
sure is likened to an energy density, this new phenomenon
implies in turn the existence of negative energy states and as
a result, it questions QFT by itself. In the same manner, it also
raises some questions as to the validity of the so-called CPT
theorem and the vacuum instability. Indeed, classically, one
considers that a particle may loose energy through the emis-
sion of a photon, so that such a process would lead to negative
energy states. But if we consider that a negative mass parti-
cle emits negative energy photons, this process would lead to
stable zero energy state.

3 Remark about Andrei Sakharov’ scheme
In classical cosmology a severe problem remains, due to the
absence of observation of primordial antimatter.
In 1967,

If one replaces the Minkowski coordinates {x0, x1, x2, x3} with
complex coordinates we may form the Hermitean Riemann

One can then easily show that the complex Poincar´e group

is an isometry group of such a Hermitean space and can be
considered as a dynamic group. Surprizingly, all classical
(matrix) calculations can be extended to such complex frame-
work, by simply substituting the matrices ∗A to the transpose
matrices TA.

As a result, the complex momentum obeys the law:

M(cid:48) = L M ∗L + N ∗P ∗L − L P ∗N,

(14)

P(cid:48) = L P,

(15)
where ∗P is the complex energy momentum 4-vector. This ex-
tended physics grants the mass a complex nature implying the
possible existence of purely real masses ±m and purely imag-
inary masses: ±(−1)1/2 m. At the same time, such masses can
exchange imaginary photons whose energies are: ±(−1)1/2 E.
Conclusion
J. M. Souriau gave the ﬁrst purely geometrical interpretation
of all classsical physics features, namely — energy, momenta,
and spin. When extended to higher dimensions it provides a
geometrical interpretation of the matter-antimatter duality. In
addition, one can notice that the complex approach of space
deﬁnition yields complex physical quantities. The physical
meaning of these complex quantities should demand further
scrutiny and as such remains a new open ﬁeld of investiga-
tions.
