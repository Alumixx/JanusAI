THE present paper investigates the relatio iship between the universes
of  relativistic  cosmology  and  the  universes  that  can  be  constructed
using  only  Newtonian  dynamics, Newtonian  gravitation,  and  New-
tonian  relativity.  It  is  shown that  the  governing  differential  equa-
tions  are  identical  in  form  in  the  two  cases,  and  that  the  localty
observable  phenomena  predicted  on  the  two  theories  are  indistin-
guishable.  It  is  further  shown  that  a  space  of  positive  curvature
corresponds  to  a  Newtonian  universe  in  which  every  particle  has  a
velocity less than  the  parabolic velocity  of  escape from  the observer,
a  space  of  negative  curvature  to  one  in  which  every  particle  has  a
velocity  greater  than  the  parabolic  velocity.  Thus  universes  of
positive,  zero, and  negative  curvatures  correspond  to  elliptic,  para-
bolic, and hyperbolic Newtonian universes respectively.  These results
are  applied  to  obtain  a  number  of  new  results  concerning  Doppler
effects  and accelerations in relativistic  universes.  Finally an  investi-
gation  due  to  Lemaitre  is briefly  discussed.

1.  The results obtained in the foregoing paper  can be extended  as
follows  to  the  case in  which,  on  Newtonian  mechanics,  the  velocity
v is not  necessarily  equal to the parabolic  velocity  of escape.  Let  v,
the velocity of a particle at distance r from  the observer at time t, be
radial in direction, and a function  of r and t.  The equation of motion,

Dv_

may  be written

where p is a  function  of  t only.  The  equation  of  continuity  may  be

and  of course M(r) is constant  following  the  motion.

It  follows  that  the  particle,  and  so  every  particle,  possesses  the
elliptic,  parabolic,  or  hyperbolic  velocity  according  as  A  § 0.  The
constant  A  is  the  same  for  all  particles.  By  (6)  or  (15),  v  obeys  a
velocity-distance  proportionality  at  any  one  epoch;  and  (15)  gives
explicitly  the  connexion  between  the mean  density p and  the  coeffi-
cient  in  the  velocity-distance  proportionality.

Differentiating  (16) following  the  motion, we see that  v obeys (1),
so that  (16) is an actual solution.  Moreover, it is clear that the  solu-
tion  satisfies  Einstein's  cosmological  principle.  The  density  p  is
obtained as a function  of t by integrating  (12) in the  form

of  relativistic  cosmology* for  an  expanding  universe  of  'radius'  R,
curvature  k/R2,  with  A  =  0,  p  =  0.  Thus  the  Newtonian  distance
r is the  same  function  of  the  Newtonian  time t as the  'distance'  r is
of  'cosmic time' t in the relativistic solutions.  Further, we see that  an
expanding  space  of  positive  curvature  (k  >  0)  corresponds  to  a
Newtonian  universe  with  elliptic  velocities  (.4  <  0),  an  expanding
space  of  negative  curvature  (k <  0)  to  a  Newtonian  universe  with
hyperbolic  velocities  (A  >  0).f  By  choice  of  a  multiplying  factor
for  R,  which  is equivalent  to  choice of  B,  k  may  be reduced to  ±  1.
The  constant  B  has  no  physical  significance;  it  disappears  from  all
formulae  relating  observable  quantities.  The  constant  A  alone is of,
physical  significance.!

It  follows  that  the  local properties  of  the  universes  in  expanding
spaces of positive, zero or negative curvatures are observationally  the
same as in Newtonian universes with velocities respectively less than,
equal to, or greater  than  the  parabolic velocity of escape.  This gives
great insight into the physical significance of expanding curved space.
3.  The 'cosmological'  terms involving  the  cosmical constant  A are
at  once  obtained,  if  we  superimpose  on  Newtonian  gravitation  a
repulsive  force  proportional  to  distance.  By  a  simple  application of
the triangle of forces the  equation of motion  (1) becomes modified  to

and  the  equation  of  continuity  is  unaffected.  The  integrations  can
now  be  carried  out  as before,§  and  we are led to  equations  for  R of
the relativistic  form  with the  usual A-terms.  Einstein's  cosmological
principle is still satisfied.  But from this point of view the introduction
of  A-terms  is  somewhat  artificial.  Their  introduction  is  permissible
simply  because  they  are  the  only  new  type  of  action  at  a  distance
(in addition to Newton's law) compatible with the satisfaction  of  the
cosmological  principle.  This last  point  may  be worthy  of remark  as
throwing light on the nature of a  'law of  gravitation'.

tions  (3.2).  It  is  clear  that  (18)  and  (19)  are  formally  identical  with  the
Newtonian  equation of motion and  its first  integral, and  that  they imply  the
equation  of  continuity.

If  A  >  0 (hyperbolic  case), as t increases, (f> or 9 steadily  increases,
and p steadily  decreases to zero.  If A  <  0 (elliptic case) 9 can  never
exceed  \nGj\A\,  and the density p has  a lower  limit,  after  which it
increases again.  We then  have an oscillating  universe.  It should be
noted  that  in  all  cases  Dv/Dt  is  always  negative,  so that  in the
Newtonian case each particle is steadily  decelerated.

In the hyperbolic case v/r -*• 0 following any particle, and v -»• const.,
though  to a different  constant  for each  particle  corresponding  to a
different  value of the parameter /.  Also, since p -*• 0, the asymptotic
form corresponds to the 'hydrodynamic' solution previously obtained*
by one of us from kinematic principles only.  This has been previously
shown  by the methods of general relativity,f  but owing to the  formal
identity  of the various  relations  with the corresponding  Newtonian
ones  it holds  in the Newtonian  case  as well.  In particular,  in this
asymptotic  case we  have  v = r/t for every  particle.  We  can  easily
show,  still  of  course  omitting  cosmical  repulsion,  that  in all other

and this exceeds unity for K  >  0.  Thus in the hyperbolic case R/R'
increases faster than t, and, from (25), R/R'  =  0 when t =  0, so that
the  inequality  (26) holds  for all t >  0.  Thus  (23) is established  in
the hyperbolic case.  In the elliptic case a similar proof  holds so long
as  R'  >  0,  and  after  that  the  inequality  is  true  a fortiori.  This
shows in a simple manner the  retarding  effect  of gravitation  on the
scattering  of the particles.

It  is of some interest to integrate  (17), or equivalently  (24); (17) is
more  significant,  since the meaningless  multiplier  B  is absent.  We

5.  Doppler  effect  in  curved  universes.  The general  features
of the  motions  studied  in  this  paper  suggest  that  in  a  relativistic
universe  the Doppler  effect  for  any given  particle  will  decrease  as
the  epoch of observation  advances, and for negative curvatures tend
to  a  constant  limit,  different  for  different  particles.  We shall now
show that  this actually is the case.

We take the metric for the 'expanding-space' universe in the form*

so that  the particles have fixed coordinates in the space  represented
by du2.  Hence if t is the 'cosmic time' of departure of a light-signal,
t2 its time of arrival at the observer, we have

where J du is the coordinate distance along the light -track, for which,
of course, ds =  0.  Hence

If  then  A  is  the  emitted  wave-length,  Ag  the  observed  wave-length,

R(t2)

since  R(t)  is  an  increasing  function  of  t,  and  t2 >  t.  This  gives  the
red-shift.  Consequently, this shift  will decrease as the  time of obser-
vation t2 advances, if 

,

that is, if

R'(t2)  <  R'(t), 

that  is, using  (29), if 
(31)
that  is, if  S'(t)  is a decreasing function  of t.  But we have proved,  (cf.
equation  (8)), that  R{t) is the  same  function  of  t, apart  from  a con-
stant  multiplier, as the  Newtonian  distance r is of Newtonian time  t,
in the corresponding Newtonian universe.  Now in this universe every
particle  is  decelerated. Hence  d2r/dt2 <  0,  or  d2E/dt2  <  0.  Hence
dB/dt  is a  decreasing  function  of  t.  Therefore  the Doppler effect de-
creaseswith  advancing epoch  of  observation.  Also, in the  asymptotic
form  of the hyperbolic case, R(t)  =  tx  const., and so

from  (28).*

These  results  are  worthy  of  note,  since  it  is  sometimes  supposed
that  particles necessarily  undergo acceleration  and not  deceleration.
As a  matter  of  fact  acceleration  away from  the  observer  is possible
only  when  cosmical  repulsion  predominates  over  gravitational
attraction.

6.  Lemaltre's  theory  of  condensations.  A  further  instance
of  the  applicability  of  the  same physical interpretation  of  the  equa-
tions  of  general  relativity  as  is  given  in  this  paper  is  provided  by
Lemaitre's  theory  of  the formation  of  condensations.t

gives a measure of the mass inside radius r.  With the addition of the
cosmical  constant  A, (32)  is  the  analogy  for  Lemaitre's  case of  our
equation  (16).

He  proceeds  to  treat  the  case  where  m(x, t) is  such  a  function  of
X alone that  there exists a real value Xo such that  the positive  values
of r  for  which  dr/dt =  0 are imaginary,  coincident,  or real,  according
as  x  >  Xo<  X =  Xo>  X <  Xo- I* follows  that,  if  r  is  small  when  t  is
small, then, if x  >  Xo> r  varies from zero to infinity; if x — Xo> r  tends
asymptotically to a value r0  >  0; if x  <  Xo> r  increases up to the  first
positive  root  of  drjdt =  0, and then  decreases again  to  zero.  That  is
to  say,  the  matter  outside  x  =  Xo  continues  to  spread  away  from
the centre, while the matter inside x  — Xo ultimately falls  back upon
itself.  This,  then,  is  the  mode  of  formation  of  condensations,  for
example, the  extra-galactic  nebulae, contemplated  by Lemaitre.  He
points out that  it is necessary for the form of this theory that  A  ^  0.
Without going further  into the implications of Lemaitre's assump-
tions, it is now clear that his work would be interpreted in Newtonian
language  by  saying  that  he  is  dealing  with  such  a  distribution  of
matter  and  motion  that  all  the particles  outside  a  certain  shell are
endowed with  a  'hyperbolic' radial  velocity of  escape from  the matter
' between themselves and the centre, while all the particles inside this shell
have an  'elliptic'  radial velocity, and so must fall  back on the centre*

*  Added  in proof:  In  a very recent paper  (Proc.  Nat. Acad.  Sci. 20 (Jan.

1934), 12-17), seen after  the above was written, Lemaitre  has himself  alluded
to  the  classical  analogy  to  his  work,  without  however  following  it  out  in
detail  or showing the  connexion  with the equation  of  continuity.
