Abstract

Through a new four components non-connex group, acting on a ten dimensional space, composed by (x,y,z,t) plus six additional
dimensions we give a description of particles like photon, proton, neutron, electrons, neutrinos (e, μ and τ) and their anti, through
the coadjoint action on the momentum space. Quantum numbers become components of the moments. Matter and antimatter are
interpreted as two different movements of mass-points in this

 { ζ 1, ζ 2, ζ 3, ζ 4, ζ 5, ζ 6, x , y , z , t } space

  
matter movement taking place in the {ζ i > 0} half space and antimatter in the remnant {ζ i < 0} one.
The ζ-Symmetry :

{ζ i ---> - ζ i }

which there goes with charge conjugation, becomes the definition of matter-antimatter duality.

 

 

1- Introduction

As pointed out by J.M.Souriau in his book [1] the Poincaré group, as a dynamic group for physics, arises a problem about the sign
of the mass.

Everything starts from the Lorentz group L, whose element L is axiomaticaly defined by:

 

 
 
 

(1)

where:
(2)

(4)

(5)

(6)

 

(7)

The Lorentz group acts on space-time:
(3)

through the action:

The matrix G comes from the expression of the Lorentz metric (with c=1):

We know than the Lorentz group is composed by four components :

Ln is the neutral componant, which contains the neutral element 1, i.e. the peculiar matrix:

Ls , the second component, contains the matrix :

which reverses space.

which reverses both space and time.

From the Lorentz group one builds the Poincaré group Gp, whose element is:

Lt , the third component, contains the matrix :

which reverses time.

Lst , the fourth component, contains the matrix :

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

C is a space-time translation:

- Its neutral component:

(12)

built with the neutral component Ln of the Lorentz group L.
 

If we use the four components of the complete Lorentz group L , (10) will be called the complete Poincaré group. As the Lotentz
group, it owns four components:

- A second component:

(13)

built with the component Ls of the Lorentz group.

- A third component:

(14)

built with the component Lt of the Lorentz group.

- and a fourth one:

(15)

 
built with the component Lst of the Lorentz group. 
 

(16)

(17)

E is the energy. 
p is the impulsion vector:

  
f is the passage vector [1].

A group acts on its momentum space [1]. Call Jp the momentum space associated to the Poincaré group.

Each peculiar moment Jp ∈ Jp, is a peculiar movement of the relativistic mass point, described by this group. On may compute the
caodjoint action of the group on the momentum [1].

The momentum is a set of 10 components (equal to the dimension of the group). These components are:

Jp = { E , px , py , pz , fx , fy , fz , sx , sy , sz } = { E , p , f , s }

 s is an antisymmetric (3,3) matrix, whose independant components are 
(19)

{ sx , sy , sz }

The momentum can be arranged into a matrix form [1], with:

  
Introduce the impulsion-Energy four-vector:

(18)

(20)

and:

(21)

(22)

 

(23)

 

Then the coadjoint action of the Poincaré group can be written into a matrix form:

It  is  interesting  to  study  the  impact  of  the  different  components  of  the  complete  Poincaré  group on  the  components  of  its
momentum. We can concentrate on peculiar matrixes :

More explicitely:
(26)

or:

(24)

(25)

(27)

(28)

(29)

  
A is the associated Lorentz matrix.

The coadjoint action gives:

  

  
and is the neutral component of the complet Poincaré group.

The corresponding coadjoint action is:

E --> E ; p --> p ; f ---> f ; s ----> s

  

which reverses space. The corresponding coadjoint action is:

E --> E ; p --> - p ; f ---> - f ; s ----> s

which reverses time. The corresponding coadjoint action is:

  E --> - E ; p --> p ; f ---> - f ; s ----> s

which reverses both space and time. The corresponding coadjoint action is:

  E --> - E ; p --> - p ; f ---> f ; s ----> s

  
As pointed out by J.M.Souriau [1], The two components

go with the inversion of the energy E ----> - E , so that it implies the inversion of the mass m ---> - m

Define the following sets of matrixes:

.

The complete Poincaré group is:
(31)  

The neutral component Gn is the first sub-group. The orthochron group [1]:

Gp = Gn U Gs U Gt U Gst

is also a sub-group of the Poincaré group.

The antichron part of the group [1]:

Go = Gn U Gs

(30)

(32)

(33)

(34)

Gac = Gt U Gst is not a group. Obvioulsy:

Gp = Go U Gac

(35)

  
 

(36)

(38)

  
As pointed out in [1] the presence of the elements of Gac = Gt U Gst may produce negative mass particles, as peculiar movements
of matter, runing backward in time. In his book [1] J.M.Souriau suggests two solution:

Either one simply decides that negative masses cannot exist.
Either the Poincaré group is limited to its orthochron subgroup.

Go = Gn U Gs

2- The central extension of the Poincaré group

  
is the central extension of the Poincaré group, built from the orhochron sub-group. 
The corresponding action is:
(37)

  
ζ is an additional dimension, a fifth dimension. The dimension of the group becomes 11 and the momentum gets a corresponding
extra component:

Jpe = { χ , M , P } = { χ , Jp }

The coadjoint action gives:
(39)

 
The  physical  meaning  of this  11th  component χ  was  neven  clearly  undestood.  Through  his  geometric  quantification  method,
J.M.Souriau shows than the spin must be quanticized [1]. Choosing a coordinate system in which the passage becomes zero, and
considering only z-motions, the Jp the momentum matrix becomes:
 

(40)

  
where E is the energy, p the modulus of the vector impulsion and s the spin.

Photons correspond to
(41)

with two distinct helicities: right and left (polarization).

Neutrinos correspond to:
(42)

 with also two distinct helicities.

Non zero mass particles like proton, electron, neutron, correspond to:
(43)

with:
(44)

(45)

(46)

 

 

From the extended Poincaré group (36), through the Kostant-Kirilov-Souriau method one can derive [1] the relativistic quantum
Klein-Gordon equation. Similarly [1] the non-relativist Bargmann group (1960) gives the non-relativistic Schödinger equation. 
 

What about antimatter?
In a former book [2] J.M. Souriau developped general relativity in five dimensions, adding an extra dimension ζ to space-time (x,
y, z, t)
Then, reference [2], Chater VII, page 413, he identifies the inversion of the fifth dimension ( ζ ---> - ζ ) to the charge conjugation
(or charge inversion, or C-symmetry) transforming matter into antimatter.
 

3- A description of quantum numbers as components of the moment of an extended group

The Poincaré group can be extended as many times one wants. Let us do it six times. Then we get:

This two components group ( due to the two components of the orthochron Lorentz group Lo ) acts on a ten dimensional space:

{ ζ 1 , ζ 2 , ζ 3 , ζ 4 , ζ 5 , ζ 6, x , y , z , t }

i.e. space time ( x , y , z , t )

plus six additional dimensions

{ ζ 1 , ζ 2, ζ 3 , ζ 4 , ζ 5 , ζ 6 }

Jpe = { χ 1, χ 2, χ 3, χ 4, χ 5, χ 6, Jp }

  
where Jp represent the classical expression of the Poincaré group's momentum.

The momentum becomes:
(47)

The coadjoint action is:
(48)

All these additional scalars are conserved and we identify these to the following classical quantum numbers:

(49)

 
We give to each first five numbers three possible values : { -1 , 0 , +1 }

The value of the gyromagnetic factor ϖ depend of the considered particle.

The momentum space is supposed to be a continuum, but one assume that discrete values of some components correspond to real
particules,  from  physics'  world.  Then  we  get a description of  elementary  particles  in  terms  of  group's  orbits. We can write the
momentum: 
 

χ 1 = q (electric charge)

χ 2 = cB (baryonic charge)
χ 3 = cL (leptonic charge)
χ 4 = cμ (muonic charge)
χ 5 = cτ (tauonic charge)
χ 6 = ϖ (gyromagnetic coefficient)

(50) Jpe = { q , cB , cL , cμ , cτ , ϖ , Jp }
Jφ = { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , Jp }: photon

Jp = { 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ϖp , Jp }: proton

Jn = { 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ϖn , Jp }: neutron

Je = { -1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , ϖe , Jp }: electron

Jνe = { 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , ϖνe , Jp }: electronic neutrino

Jνμ = { 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , ϖνμ , Jp }: μ neutrino

Jντ = { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , ϖντ , Jp }: τ neutrino

 ......

We transform a particle into the corresponding antiparticle through charge conjugation (C-symmetry). The charges of the photon
are all zero, so that it identifies with its antiparticle.
 

4- Suggested geometric definition of antimatter

A particle is a species, corresponding to a sub-set of the momentum space. It corresponds to peculiar choices in some components
of the momentum, the charges:

{ q , cB , cL , cμ , cτ , ϖ }  

A momentum is a movement of a mass-point, governed by a dynamic group. Here an extension of the orthochron Poincaré's sub-
group.

Classically  (Dirac's antimatter)  one  considers  that  reversing  the  charge  (C-symmetry  of charge conjugation)  transforms  matter
into anti matter

(51)

(52)

{ - q , - cB , - cL , - cμ , - cτ , - ϖ }

Then we can classify the particles, through their momentum space, into two sub-sets, the first containing matter and the second
anti  matter.  Schematically,  photons  have been figured on  the  borde  between  the  two,  for  they  are identical to antiphotons. See
figure 1.

  

  

Fig.1: Classification of particles.

  As  we  know  each  momentum  correspond  to a movement. Here we consider movements  in  a  ten-dimensional  space, a fibered
space-time, as evoked on figure 2.
 

  

  

Fig.2: Fibered space-time.

As shown of the figure we suggest that matter-antimatter duality corresponds to a:
(53)

ζ - Symmetry: {ζ i} ---> { - ζ i }

Particles move in { ζ  i> 0 } half-space and antiparticles in the other { ζ  i< 0 } one. Photons move in { ζ  i = 0 } plane. Their
movement is not changed by ζ-Symmetry, so that they are identical to their antiparticle.

In  this  paper  we deal with  an  extended  16-dimensional  orthochron  group.  We can figure schematically the  coadjoint  action of
such a group on its moment space and associated movement space. See figures 3, 4 and 5.

  

  Fig. 3 : Movement of matter, in the { ζ i > 0 } half 10d-space and coadjoint action on the momentum. 

The link between momentum and movement has been figured.

 

 

  

  Fig. 4 : Movement of antimatter, in the { ζ i < 0 } half 10d-space and coadjoint action on the momentum. 

The link between momentum and movement has been figured.

  

  

Fig. 5: Movement of photons, in the { ζ i = 0 } plane and coadjoint action on the momentum. 

The link between momentum and movement has been figured.

We  have  extended  the  othochron  Poincaré  sub-group,  corresponding  to  positive  energy  particles to a 16-dimensional  group,
acting:

 

Conclusion

- On a 16-dimensional momentum space
- On a 10-dimensional movement space. 
 

Particles
Antiparticles
Photons.

The extension gives the momentum six extra components, which are identified to charges, so that we get a geometric description
of usual elementary particles: photon, proton, electron, neutrons , e , μ and τ neutrinos and their antis.

This provides a classification of particles in terms of momentum's components, defining three basic species:

each corresponding to a sub-set of the ( E > 0 ) momentum space. Then we suggest a basic definition of antimatter, and photons,
in terms of peculiar movements in a 10d-space.

 { ζ i > 0 } corresponding to matter.

 { ζ i < 0 } corresponding to antimatter.
 { ζ i = 0 } corresponding to photons. 
 

This is similar to Plato's vision.
