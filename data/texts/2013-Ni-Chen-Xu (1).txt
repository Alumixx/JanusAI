the invariance of coupling equation of    and    under either the combined space-time inversion

1. Introduction 
In 1956-1957, the historical discovery of the parity vio- 
lation  [3-6]  reveals  that  both  P  and  C  symmetries  are 
violated to maximum in weak interactions. Then in 1964- 
1970,  both  CP  and  T  are  experimentally  verified  to  be 
violated  in  some  cases  (though  to  a  tiny  degree)  [7,8] 
whereas  the  product  symmetry  CPT  holds  intact  to  this 
day  [9].  The  CPT  invariance  in  quantum  field  theory 
(QFT)  was  first  proved  by  Lüders  and  Pauli  in  1954- 
1957  [10-12]  via  the  introduction  of  the  “strong  reflec- 
tion” for proving the CPT theorem. In 1965, Lee and Wu 
proposed  that  the  definition  of  particle  a   versus  its 
antiparticle  a   should be [13]   
a

                              (1.1) 
Regrettably,  the  counterpart  of  “strong  reflection”  at 
the  level  of  RQM  went  nearly  unnoticed  in  the  past 
decades. In  this  paper, we are  going  to  study  the  RQM 
   is 
thoroughly.  Not  only  a  discrete  symmetry 
found in RQM as the counterpart of “strong reflection” in 
QFT, it is also evolved into the invariance of space-time 
inversion  

, showing that a WF in RQM is always com- 
posed of two parts in confrontation inside a particle and 
then RQM becomes a self-consistent theory. Furthermore, 
this symmetry can serve as a “theoretical tool” in search- 
ing for new applications in today’s physics.

The organization of this paper is as follows: In section 
II,  the  EPR  paradox  [14]  is  discussed  together  with  the 
K
  correlation  experimental  data  [1],  yielding  a 
strong hint that the energy-momentum operators for anti-   
  re-

spectively. Section III is focused on a discrete symmetry

bined  space-time  inversion  (with 
), 
while     the  transformation  of  WFs  between  particle 
and  antiparticle,  whose  definition  is  just  residing  in  the 
symmetry. Then after combining with FV dissociation of 
KG  equation  [2]  in  which  the  WF    is  composed  of 
two fields:      , the above symmetry can be rea- 
lized  in  terms  of    and    rigorously  via  the  inva- 
riance of their coupling equation either under the space- 
time  inversion  or  a  mass  inversion  

way,  the  probability  density  is  ensured  to  be  positive 
definite for WFs of either particle or antiparticle. Section 
IV  ascribes  various  phenomena  in  the  theory  of  special 
relativity (SR) to the effects of enhancement of the hid- 
den    field  in  a  moving  particle.  In  Section  V,  Dirac 
equation is discussed accordingly with the importance of 
helicity  being  stressed.  Section  VI  contains  a  brief  dis- 
cussion  on  the  QFT.  Sections  VII,  VIII  and  IX  are  de- 
voting  to  seek  for  possible  applications  of  the  above 
symmetry  in  today’s  physical  problems:  Why  a  parity 
violation phenomenon was overlooked since 1956-1957? 
Why we believe neutrinos are likely the tachyons? And 
the  prediction  of  antigravity  between  matter  and  anti- 
matter.  The  last  Section  X  contains  a  summary.  In  the 
Appendix, the Klein paradox is solved for both KG equa- 
tion  and  Dirac  equation  without  resorting  to  the  “hole 
theory”.

Experimental Data Are Telling? 

To our knowledge, beginning from Bohm and Bell [15,16], 
physicists gradually turned their research of EPR paradox 
[14] onto the entangled state composed of electrons, es- 
pecially photons with spin and achieved fruitful results. 
However,  as  pointed  out  by  Guan  (1935-2007),  EPR’s 
paper [14] is focused on two spinless particles and Guan 
found that there is a commutation relation hiding in such 
a system as follows [17]:

According to QM’s principle, there may be a kind of 
common  eigenstate  having  eigenvalues  of  these  two 
commutative (i.e., compatible)observables like: 
D

      (2.2) 
with D being their distance. The existence of such kind 
of eigenstate described by Equation (2.2) puzzled Guan, 
he  asked:  “How  can  such  kind  of  quantum  state  be 
realized?” A discussion between Guan and one of present 
authors (Ni) in 1998 led to a paper [18]. 

Here we are going to discuss further, showing that the 
0K K   system  (which  just 
correlation  experiment  on  a 
realized  an  entangled  state  composed  of  two  spinless 
particles) in 1998 by CPLEAR collaboration [1] actually 
revealed  some  important  features  of  QM  and  then  an- 
swered  the  puzzle  raised  by  EPR  in  a  surprising  way. 
First, besides Equation (1), let us consider another three 
commutation relations simultaneously:

i-th particle is detected). In accordance with Ref. [1], we 
also  focus  on  back-to-back  events.  The  evolution  of 
0K K ’s wavefunction (WF) will be considered in three 
inertial frames: The center-of-mass system S is at rest in 
laboratory with its origin x = 0 located at the apparatus’ 
center,  where  the  antiprotons’  beam  is  stopped  inside  a 
0K K   pairs  by  pp   an- 
hydrogen  gas  target  to  create 
0K K   pairs are detected by a cylindrical 
nihilation. The 
tracking  detector  located  inside  a  solenoid  providing  a 
magnetic  field  parallel  to  the  antiprotons’  beam.  For 
back-to-back events, the space-time coordinates in Equa- 
tions (1)-(5) refer to particles moving to the right   

x 
  respectively.  Second,  we 
1
take an inertial system  S   with its origin located at par- 
ticle 1 (i.e., 
x  ).  S   is moving in a uniform velocity 
1
v   with  respect  to  S .  (For  Kaon’s  momentum  of

800 MeV/c,
. S

we  have  Lorentz  transformation  among  the  space-time

In  summary,  instead  of  one  set  of  WF  with  its  ope- 
rators  (Equations  (2.19)  and  (2.20)),  two  sets  of  WFs 
with  operators  separately  (shown  as  Equations  (2.18)- 
(2.21)) are strongly supported by the original EPR para- 
  experi- 
dox and its “solution” provided by the 
ment. 

To our knowledge, Equation (2.18) can be found at a 
page  note  of  a  paper  by  Konopinski  and  Mahmaud  in 
1953 [21], also appears in Refs. [18,22-28].

In hindsight, for a linear equation in RQM, either KG 
or Dirac equation, the emergence of WFs with both posi- 
tive and negative energy  
E   is inevitable and natural. 
From mathematical point of view, the set of WFs cannot 
be  complete  if  without  taking  the  negative  energy  so- 
lutions  into  account.  And  physicists  believe  that  these 
negative-energy  solutions  might  be  relevant  to  anti- 
particles. However, we physicists admit that both a rest 
  and  a  rest  antiparticle’s  en- 
particle’s  energy 
  are positive, as verified by nume- 
ergy 

rous experiments like that of pair-creation process   
.  The  above  contradiction  constructs  so- 

called  “negative-energy  paradox”  in  RQM.  For  Dirac 
particle, majority (not all) of physicists accept the “hole 
theory” to explain the “paradox”. But for KG particle, no 
such kind of “hole theory” can be acceptable. It was this 
“negative-energy  paradox”  as  well  as  the  four  “com- 
mutation relations”, Equations (2.1)-(2.5), hidden in the 
two-particle  system  discussed  by  EPR  [14]  gradually 
prompted us to realize that the root cause of difficulty in 
RQM  lies  in  an  a  priori  notion—only  one  kind  of  WF 
with one set of operators (like Equation (3.2)) can be ac- 
ceptable in QM, either for NRQM or RQM. 

 

Once getting rid of the constraint in the above notion 
and introducing two sets of WFs and operators for par- 
ticle  and  antiparticle  respectively,  we  can  identify  the 
negative  energy  solution,  Equation  (3.9),  with  the  anti- 
particle’s WF directly

cE  
which  implies  an  antiparticle  with  positive  energy 
by  using  Equation  (2.18).  This  claim  will  be  proved 
rigorously in the next subsection. 

One may ask: When you assume the negative energy 
solution being the WF of antiparticle, how about the dif- 
ficulty  of  negative  probability  density?  Below  we  will 
see  how  to  solve  these  two  difficulties  simultaneously 
and  make  KG  equation  a  self-consistent  theory  at  the 
level of RQM.

c’) From mathematical point of view, we should keep 
all negative-energy solutions for one equation. However, 
even  facing  WFs  in  doubled  numbers,  we  still  don’t 
know how to choose half of them for describing particle 
and its antiparticle separately in physics. 

But  we  haven’t  solve  the  difficulty  of  negative  pro- 
bability density in KG equation yet, awaiting for another 
enlightenment which was already there since 1958.

Let  us  try  to  reinterpret  the  phenomena  displayed  in 
the kinematics of special relativity (SR) via the enhance- 
ment of    field in a particle [22-25]: 

(a) Lorentz transformation 
Consider a particle’s WF shown by Equation (4.3a) in 
an  inertial  frame  S  (laboratory).  Then  take  another  S  
frame resting on the particle, so

Here the space-time coordinates  

and  defined  in  the  S   frame  via  the  phase  of  WF  as 
follows:  Based  on  the  assertion  that  “phase  remains 
invariant  under  the  coordinate  transformation”  which 
was  named  the  “law  of  phase  harmony”  by  de  Broglie 
and was regarded by himself as the fundamental achieve- 
ment  all  his  life  [34],  comparing  the  phase  in  Equation 
(4.4) with that in Equation (4.3a) and using

Then,  all  formulas  in  the  Lorentz  transformation  can 
be obtained. In some sense, what used here is a particle’s 
wave-packet which serves as a microscopic “ruler”, also 
a “clock” simultaneously. 

(b) There is a speed limit c for a massive particle. 
For a free KG particle, using Equation (3.33), we may 
define  an  “impurity  ratio”  R   for  the  amplitude  of

increases monotonously. The particle becomes more and 
    as  a  limit  of  particle 
more  “impure”  until 
being  still  a  particle.  As  shown  by  Equation  (4.6),  the 
reason why its velocity has a limiting value c (the speed 
of light) is because    and    have opposite evolution 
tendencies  in  space-time  as  shown  by  Equations  (4.1)- 
(4.3) essentially,    strives to hold    back from going 
forward  until  a  balance  nearly  reached  when     
and  v

(c) The “length contraction” (FitzGerald-Lorentz con- 

traction) and “time dilation” 

As  usual,  we  will  show  “length  contraction”  via  a 
wave-packet of KG particle moving at a high-speed   v  
but  further  ascribe  it  to  the  enhancement  of    field 
hidden inside the particle. 

First, consider a wave-packet of KG particle at rest [25,

which is the counterpart of Equation (4.6) for a plane WF

With  these  calculations,  we  might  intuitively  under- 
stand the length contraction as an effect of coupling (i.e. 
entanglement)  between    and    fields  due  to  their 
opposite  evolution  tendencies  in  space  as  discussed  in 
previous point (b). 

Let’s turn to the “time dilation” shown by the variation

of  a  particle,  say,  a  pion  ( π   or  π )  with  its  velocity

To understand it, let’s return back to Equations (4.1)- 
c   on its complex 
(4.3) at 
plane  with  Re  and  Im  ( Re c   and  Im c )  as 
abscissa and ordinate. We may see that the time reading 
of the “inner clock” for a particle (or an antiparticle) is 
“clockwise”  (or  “counter  clockwise”).  Thus  with  the 
increase  of  particle  velocity,  though  the  time  reading 
remains clockwise (due to the dominance of    field), it 
runs  slower  and  slower  because  of  the  enhancement  of 
hidden    field.

However,  the  fact  that  there  is  an  upper  bound  for 
particle’s velocity doesn’t mean that no speed can exceed 
that of light,  c . Indeed, there is another velocity

maintain the quantum coherence of WF in the space-time

In  1923,  de  Broglie  discovered  Equation  (4.15)  in  his 
relativistic theory. However, in the Schrödinger equation 
of  NRQM,  the  phase  velocity  remains  undefined.  See 
Ref [34].

In Equation (6.1), the annihilation operator  ˆap   for par- 
†ˆbp   for  antiparticle  in 
ticle  and  the  creation  operator 
Fock space are introduced. In Equation (6.2), instead of 
index  s   (
, the spin’s projection along the fixed 
z   axis in space), the helicity  h   is used. See Ref. [37]. 
Let  us  return  back  to  the  CPT  theorem  proved  by 
Lüders  and  Pauli  in  1954-1957  [10-12].  The  proof  of 
CPT  theorem  contains  a  crucial  step  being  the  con- 
struction of so-called “strong reflection”, consisting in a 
reflection  of  space  and  time  about  some  arbitrarily 
chosen origin, i.e. 

t
   

Pauli  proposed  and  explained  the  strong  reflection  in 
Ref.  [12]  as  follows:  When  the  space-time  coordinates 
change their sign, every particle transforms into its anti- 
particle simultaneously. The physical sense of the strong 
reflection  is  the  substitution  of  every  emission  (absorp- 
tion) operator of a particle by the corresponding absorp- 
tion  (emission)  operator of  its  antiparticle.  And  there  is 
no  need  to  reverse  the  sign of  the  electric  charge when 
the sign of space-time coordinates is reversed. 

What Pauli claimed, in our understanding, means that

The  mutual  transformation,  Equation  (6.3),  in  Fock 
space ensures the field operators, Equation (6.1), invari- 
ant  under  the strong  reflection  in  the  sense  of  (see  also

Here it is important to notice that the helicity,  h , will 
be  reversed  before  and  after  the  strong  reflection  for  a 

particle  and  its  antiparticle  respectively  as  discussed  in 
Section  V.  Because Equation (6.2)  is written  in 4  com- 
ponent  spinor  covariant  form,  the  invariance  of  Dirac 
field  operator  under  the  strong  reflection  should  be  ex- 
pressed rigorously as

                    (6.7) 

which  are  useful  in  proving  the  “spin-statistics  con- 
nection” by strong reflection invariance. 

QFT  is  a  successful  theory  just  because  it  is  estab- 
lished on sound basis with the field operator being one of 
its  cornerstones.  Historically,  through  various  trials  and 
checks, Equations (6.1)-(6.2) were eventually found (see 
Section 3.5 of Ref. [36]). Why they are correct and why 
one would fail otherwise? In our understanding, it is just 
because they are invariant under the strong reflection as 
shown by Equations (6.4) and (6.6). 

However,  as  emphasized  by  Pauli  [12]  and  further 
stressed by Lüders [11], at least two more rules should be 
added in doing calculations: 

(a) The order of an operator product in Fock space has

Furthermore,  they  proved  the  CPT  theorem  via  the 
identification of the product of T, C, and P in QFT with 
the  combined  operation  of  the  strong  reflection  and  a 
Hermitian conjugation. 

The  validity  of  CPT  invariance,  i.e.  Equations  (6.8) 
and (6.9) has been verified experimentally since the dis- 
covery  of  parity  violation  ([3-8]  etc.)  and the  establish- 
ment (and development) of standard model ([38] etc.) in 
particle physics till this day. See the excellent book, Ref. 
[19] and the Review of Particle Physics, Ref. [9]. 

After  restudying  the  historical  contribution  of  Pauli- 
Lüders strong reflection invariance, we feel good in un- 
derstanding that what we claim in RQM (Sections III-V) 
is essentially the same as or very close to their idea. 

In fact, this paper is the direct continuation of our first 
one in 1974 [22], which was inspired jointly by the dis- 
coveries  of  violations  in  P,  C,  CP,  T  symmetries  in- 
dividually (but CPT invariance holds), also by Lee-Wu’s 
proposal in 1965 that the relationship between a particle 
a   and its antiparticle  a   should be [13]:

                      (6.10) 

and  especially  by  Pauli’s  invention  of  the  strong  re- 
flection in 1955 [12]. 

Below, we would like to show that WFs for a particle 
and its antiparticle given in Equations (5.7) and (5.8) are 
precisely that derived from QFT as expected. 

Using Equation (6.2) for Dirac field, we find the WF

7. An Oversight in QFT (Helicity States or 
Spin States?)—Why a Parity-Violation 
Phenomenon Was Overlooked Since 
1956-1957? 

Through  analysis  in  RQM  till  QFT,  we  stress  the  ne- 
cessity  of  using  helicity   h   to  describe  a  fermion  or 
antifermion. Here is an interesting example. Since 2002, 
Shi  and  Ni  [39-43]  predicted  a  parity-violation  pheno- 
menon as follows: 

An unstable (decaying) fermion (e.g., neutron or muon) 
has different mean lifetimes for being right-handed (RH) 
or  left-handed  (LH)  polarized  during  its  flight  with  the 
same speed

This  is  not  a  small  effect.  For  instance,  in  Fermilab, 
physicists  consider  to  build  a  muon  collider  [44].  The 
collision of     and     beams must happen before the 
muons decay. It was estimated that if a muon rings along 
at 1.5 TeV, the time dilation of SR stretches its lifetime 
to  30  milliseconds—up  from  2  microseconds  when  it’s 
still. That’s time enough for 500 circuits in the final ring. 
However, as discussed in Ref. [43], if the prediction of 
life asymmetry Equation (7.1) is correct, the lifetime of 
RH     will be stretched to 146 days while that of LH 
   only  15  milliseconds.  The  lifetime  asymmetry  of 
   will be just the opposite as shown by Equation (7.2). 
Therefore,  it  seems  necessary  to  take  Equations  (7.1)- 
(7.2) into account in the design of a muon collider. 

The problem is: How can such a parity-violation phe- 
nomenon  be  overlooked  since  1956-1957?  One  the- 
oretical reason is: in the past, for describing a fermion in 
flight  
, instead of helicity states, the “spin-states” 
assigned  by  s   (spin’s  projection  along  the  fixed  z  
axis in space) were often incorrectly used (see [40-42]). 
So previous calculations on the lifetime always led to a

8The wonderful experiment by Wu et al. [6] reveals the decay configu-
ration of a polarized neutron bearing a strong resemblance to a “comet”
with  its  “head”  oriented  along  neutron’s  spin  parallel  to  z axis  in 
space (note that a static neutron has no helicity  h , see [45]) while its 
“tail” composed of emitted  e   and 
e . So it was expected intuitively 
that [39] if one pushes the “comet” along its “head”’s direction, it (sud-
1h    and) will be relatively more stable than it is 
denly has a helicity 
h   ). That’s what Equation (7.1)
pushed along its “tail” (when it has 
means and why the use of “spin state” fails to get it right.

Hence, we understand the reason why a Dirac particle 
respects the parity symmetry as shown by Equation (8.7) 
is because it enjoys the symmetry Equation (8.6) hiding 
in the 2-component spinor form (in Weyl representation).

Now  a  question  arises:  Can  we  find  an  equation  which 
violates the symmetry of pure space inversion? 

The answer is “yes”. Let’s introduce a new equation in 
Weyl  representation  from  Equation (8.5) by  erasing  the 
m m  
superscript  (D),  replacing  the  mass  term  by 
s
and  changing  its  sign  from  “+”  to  “−”  in  the  first  equ-

equalities  of  Equation  (8.43)  does  reverse  the  status  of 
c   versus

versed  explicitly.  The  subtlety  of  tachyon  equation,  un- 
like Dirac equation, lies in the fact that only 
R  
L   are  strictly  forbidden,  i.e., 
exist  whereas 
the parity symmetry is violated to maximum. Hence, in 
strict  sense,  there  is  also  no  physically  meaningful  WF 
after the operation of pure “time inversion” on Equation 
(8.15).  We  will  insist  on  Equation  (8.31)  rather  than 
Equation  (8.42)—there  is  only  one  correct  way  leading 
from  tachyon  to  antitachyon  via  the     inversion  es- 
sentially.

In  2000,  Equation  (8.25)  was  first  proposed  by  Tsao 
Chang  and  then  collaborated  with  Ni  in  Ref.  [46]  (see 
also [47-52] and the Appendix 9B in Ref. [25]). At first 
sight, the difference between Equations (8.25) and (8.1) 
amounts  to  substituting  the  mass  term  m   by 
sm    
s
  being  an  antihermitian  matrix.

Usually, for an equation with nonhermitian Hamiltonian, 
there is no guarantee for the completeness of its mathe- 
matical solutions. In other words, the unitarity of its phy- 
sical  states  is  at  risk.  Sometimes,  however,  a  non-  her- 
mitian  Hamiltonian  can  be  accepted  in  physics.  For 
example,  in  the  optical  model  for  nuclear  physics,  an 
imaginary  part  of  potential, 
,  is  used  to 
describe the absorption of incident particles successfully. 
The  interesting  thing  for  “tachyonic  neutrino”  is:  Solu-

(8.37)  and  (8.40).  It  seems  like  half  of  would-be  solu- 
tions  disappear  automatically.  Equivalently,  from  phy- 
sical  point  of  view,  only  half  of  states  with 
0   or 
c    are allowed in nature whereas another half with 
0   or 
c    are not. Hence  one  unique  feature  of 
“tachyon” equation, like Equation (8.15) or (8.26), lies in 
its  strange  realization  of  unitarity  violation  that  half  of 
would-be  states  (being  tentatively  identified  with 
R  
and 
L )  are  absolutely  forbidden  whereas  another  half 
(
L   and 
R )  are  stabilized.  The  permanently  longitu- 
dinal  polarization  property  of  neutrino  and  antineutrino 
like that analysed above was first predicted by Lee and 
Yang  in  1957  [3-5]  and  had  been  verified  by  GGS  ex- 
periment in 1958 [53]. Further discussion on this topic is 
currently in preparation.

It  seems  quite  clear  that  Equation  (9.1)  is  invariant 
under  the  space-time  inversion  
  and 
Equation  (9.2)  remains  invariant  under  the  mass  inver- 
sion  
  We  believe  that  these  two  discrete 
symmetries  are  deeply  rooted  at  the  SR’s  dynamics  via 
its combination with QM and developing into RQM and 
QFT—the  particle  and  its  antiparticle  are  treated  on 
equal footing and linked by the symmetry 
   es- 
sentially.  Hence  we  can  perform  a  mass  inversion  on 
Equation  (9.2)  in  each  of  two  inertial  frames  with  ar- 
bitrary relative velocity  v   in the sense of

The invariance of Equation (9.2) under mass inversion 
as a whole reflects the experimental fact that particle and 
antiparticle  are  equally  existing  in  nature  even  at  the 
level of classical physics. 

Example:  The  motion  equation for  a  charged particle 
e   )  in  the  external

electric and magnetic fields,  E   and  B , is given by the 
Lorentz formula:

Based on what we learn from RQM (Sections III-V) as 
well as Equations (9.1)-(9.5), we may conjecture that for 
a  classical  theory  being  capable  of  treating  matter  and 
antimatter on an equal footing, it must be invariant under 
a mass inversion 

  . 

Notice that, however, Equation (9.4) (Equation (9.5)) 
is  only  valid  for  particle  (antiparticle)  moving  at  low 
speed, it must be modified to adapt to high-speed cases 
through  the  invariance  of  continuous  Lorentz  transfor- 
mation.  So we  need  “double  checks” for  testing  a  clas- 
sical theory being really “relativistic” or not.

Of course, Equation (9.6) is covariant with respect to 
the  Lorentz  transformation.  But  could  it  withstand  the 
test of mass inversion? 

On  the  LHS  of  Equation  (9.6),  the  Einstein  tensor 
G  contains no any mass and no charge as well. But on 
the  RHS,  the  energy-momentum  current  density  tensor 
T  is proportional to particle’s mass m and so changes 
its  sign  under  an  operation  of  m
m  .  Hence  as  a 
whole, Equation (9.6) cannot remain invariant under the 
mass inversion. The reason seems rather clear that anti- 
matter  was  not  taking  into  account  when  GR  was  es- 
tablished  in 1915.  To  modify  EFE  such  that  it  can pre- 
serve the invariance of mass inversion, in 2004, one of us 
cT  for  anti- 
(Ni)  proposed  to  add  another  term  with 
matter, yielding [27]

In a weak-field (or the post-Newtonian) approximation,

1n   
whereas

tions  (9.11)  and  (9.12)  for  the  case  of  “like  sources” 
ee  ) [57], where the case for “unlike sources” 
(with 

0
ee 
  hadn’t  been  discussed.  Here  Equation  (9.11) 
has been generalized to the case for “unlike sources”, but 
at a price that the “equivalence principle” in GR ceases 
to be valid when matter and antimatter coexist as shown 
by Equation (9.10). 

In 2011, the antigravity between matter and antimatter 
was  also  claimed  by  Villata  in  Ref.[58],  where  the  ar- 
gument  seems  different  from  that  explained  above.  But 
theory is theory, only fact will have the final say. So we 
are  anxiously waiting  for  the  outcome  from  the  AEGIS 
experiment  [59]  (at  CERN),  which  is  designed  to  com- 
pare the Earth gravitational acceleration on hydrogen and 
antihydrogen atoms.

10. Summary 
1)  Being  the  combination  of  SR  and  QM,  RQM  is 
capable  of  dealing  with  particle  and  antiparticle  on  an 
equal footing. As long as we admit that the antiparticle’s 
momentum  and  energy  operators  should  be  ˆ

particle, it can be proved that the “negative-energy” WF 
  of  particle  corresponds  to  a  “positive-energy”  WF 
c   of antiparticle precisely.

2) In general, an equation in RQM always has a dis- 
crete  symmetry 
   which  shows  up  as  a  trans- 
formation  between  a  particle’s  WF     and  its  anti- 
particle’s  WF 
.  For  a  free  par-

ticle,  it  simply  means

conformity with the “strong reflection” in QFT invented 
by Pauli and Lüders, showing that the intrinsic property 
of a particle cannot be detached from the space-time.

3)  Following  Feshbach-Villars’  deep  insight,  we  are 
able to divide each and every WF    in RQM into two 
parts,      .  Then  the  above  symmetry  is  further 
rigorously expressed by an invariance of motion equation 
in  RQM  through  the  transformations 
c    and 
c    under either the space-time inversion

  or  a  mass  inversion  

Since   
c ,  we 
  in 
may name    as the (dominant) hidden particle field in 
  while    the  (subordinate)  hidden  antiparticle  field 
in  . In this way, both the “probability density”    for 
a particle and 
c   for an antiparticle can be proved to be 
positive  definite.  Now  we  may  say  that  the  RQM  is 
ensured  to  be  self-consistent  and  can  be  regarded  as  a 
sound basis for QFT.

4) All kinematical effects in SR can be ascribed to the 
enhancement of the magnitude of    field in a particle’s 
WF  accompanying  with  the  increase  of  particle’s  ve- 
locity. 

5) As proved for Dirac particle with spin, the helicity 
of  a  particle  is  just  opposite  to  that  of  its  antiparticle 
under  a  space-time  (or  mass)  inversion.  Therefore,  the 
experimental tests for the CPT invariance should include 
not  only  the  equal  mass  and  lifetime  of  particle  versus 
antiparticle, but also the following fact: A particle and its 
antiparticle with opposite helicities must coexist in nature 
with no exception. A prominent example is the neutrino 
—A neutrino 
R ) is permanently left- 
handed (right-handed) polarized whereas the fact that no 
R   exists  in  nature  must  means  no 
L   as  well  (as 
verified by the GGS experiment [53]). See also Section 
VII. 

L   (antineutrino 

6. Based on the invariance of space-time inversion or 
mass  inversion  (at  the  level  of  RQM)  and  the  latter’s 
generalization to the classical physics, we tentatively dis- 
cuss  some  interesting  problems  in  today’s  physics,  in- 
cluding the prediction of antigravity between matter and 
antimatter,  as  well  as  the  reason  why  we  believe  neu- 
trinos are likely the tachyons.

Appendix: Klein Paradox for Klein-Gordon 
Equation and Dirac Equation 
We  will  discuss  the  Klein  paradox  [60]  for  both  KG 
equation and Dirac equation based on Sections III and V, 
without resorting to the “hole” theory. 

AI: Klein Paradox for KG Equation

dimensional space and hits a step potential

(See  Ref.  [18]  or  § 9.4  in  Ref.  [25],  where  discussions 
are  not  complete  and  need  to  be  complemented  and 
corrected here). Because the kinetic energy  E   at

the particle still remain as a particle?

As  discussed  in  Section  III,  for  a  KG  particle  (or  its 
antiparticle), two criterions must be held: its probability 
density  ρ  (or 
c )  must  be  positive  and  its  probability 
cj ) must be in the same direction 
current density 
of its momentum  p   (or

Equation (A.8) is certainly not allowed. So to consider 
p    moving to the right 
a “particle” with momentum 
p   
makes  no  sense.  Instead,  we  should  consider 
0
(which  also  makes  no  sense  for  a  particle  due  to  the 
t   as  an  antiparticle’s 
boundary  condition)  and  regard 
WF by rewriting it as:

but 
then similar to Equations (A.10) and (A.11), we would get 
cp   are negative, meaning that the antiparticle is coming 
both 
from  z   ,  not  in  accordance  with  our  boundary  condition.  So  the 
p    should be abandoned either as a particle or as an anti-
case of

Above equations show us that the incident KG particle 
z  , 
triggers a process of “pair creation” occurring at 
0
creating new particles moving to the left side (to join the 
reflected  incident  particle)  so  enhancing  the  reflectivity 
KGR    and  new  antiparticles  (with  equal  number  of 
new particles) moving to the right. 

To our understanding, this is not a stationary state pro- 
blem  for  a  single  particle,  but  a  nonstationary  creation 
process  of  many  particle-antiparticle  system.  It  is  ama- 
zing to see the Klein paradox in KG equation being ca- 
pable of giving some prediction for such kind of process 
at  the  level  of  RQM.  Further  investigations  are  needed 
both theoretically and experimentally.10 

AII: Klein Paradox for Dirac Equation 
Beginning from Klein [60], many authors e.g. Greiner et 
al. [61,62], have studied this topic. We will join them by 
using  the  similar  approach  like  that  for  KG  equation 
discussed above. 

Based on similar picture shown in Figure 1, now we 

have three Dirac WFs under the condition

10We find from the Google search that R. G. Winter in 1958 had written 
a  paper  titled  “Klein  paradox  for  the  Klein-Gordon  equation”  and 
reached  basically  the  same  result  as  ours.  So  he  was  the  first  author 
dealing  with  this  problem.  Regrettably,  it  seems  that  his  paper  had 
never been published on some journal.

The variation of 

DT   bears some resemblance to Equ- 
ation  (A.15)  for  KG  equation  but  shows  striking  dif- 
ference due to sharp contrast between Equations (A.24)- 
(A.28) and Equations (A.12)-(A.15). 

To our understanding, in the above Klein paradox for 
Dirac  equation,  there  is  no  “pair  creation”  process  oc- 
z  . The paradox just amounts 
curring at the boundary 
to  a  steady  transmission  of  particle’s  wave 
i   into  a 
z 
high  potential  barrier 
  region 
0
where 
t   shows up as an antiparticle’s WF propagating 
to  the  right.  In  some  sense,  the  existence  of  a  potential 
0V   plays  a  “magic”  role  of  transforming  the 
barrier 
particle into its antiparticle. Because the probability den- 
sities of both particle and antiparticle are positive definite, 
the  total  probability  can  be  normalized  over  the  entire 
space like that for one particle case:

The argument for the validity of his Equations (A.30)- 
(A.31) is based on the hole theory (see also section 5.2 in 
, there would be 
Ref. [62]), saying that once 
an overlap between the occupied negative continuum for 
z    and the empty positive continuum for 
z  , pro- 
viding a mechanism for electron-positron pair creation if 
z    can  be  identified  with  a  positron. 
the  “hole”  at 
We doubt  the “hole”  theory  seriously  because  there  are 
only two electrons (with opposite spin orientations) stay- 
ing at each energy level in the negative continuum. So it 
seems that there is no abundant source for electrons and 
1T    in Equ- 
“holes” to account for the huge value of 
ation (A.30). 

Fortunately,  we  learn  from  section  10.7  in  Ref.  [62] 
that if the Klein paradox in Dirac equation is treated at 
the  level  of  QFT,  their  result  turns  out  to  be  the  same 
form  as  our  Equations  (A.24)-(A.28),  rather  than  Equ- 
ations (A.30) and (A.31). 

A. There is a mistake contained in the paragraph following Equation (8.43) on

page 667, which needs to be corrected and modiﬁed as follows:

Note that

(8.45)

c (η(cid:48)

Here ξ(cid:48)
c) is the hidden RH (LH) spinning ﬁeld in an antitachyon after the ”pure
time inversion”. Notice that the sign change x → −x in the phase of WF makes a
change in the direction of momentum pc → −pc. But a WF is always composed
of two ﬁelds in confrontation, like ηc versus ξc (or η(cid:48)
c) here. And the ex-
plicit helicity hc is determined by which one of those two hidden ﬁelds being in
charge. So the change of x → −x in Equation (8.43) does reverse the status of ηc
versus ξc (or η(cid:48)
c), rendering the helicity reversed explicitly. Hence, besides
the space-time inversion symmetry in Dirac representation as shown by Equations

c vs. ξ(cid:48)

c vs. ξ(cid:48)

(8.26)-(8.28), the tachyon equation does have its unique ”pure time inversion”

symmetry in Weyl representation as shown by Equations (8.42) [i.e., (8.44)] and

(8.15). Among antitachyon WFs gained after the ”pure time inversion”, only those
for ¯νR with ρ(cid:48)

c > 0 are allowed, whereas those for ¯νL with ρ(cid:48)

c < 0 are forbidden.

B. After Equation (A.14) on page 673, a ”Note” should be added as follows:
Note: Once when E(cid:48) = E − V0 < 0, we may regard ψt directly as a WF ψ(cid:48)
c of
antiparticle and use Equations (3.31)-(3.32) to get the same results, Equations

(A.12)-(A.14). Actually, the continuity conditions at the space boundary z = 0,

Equation (A.5), hold at all times (not just at time t = 0).
