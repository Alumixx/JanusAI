ABSTRACT
The motion data of the S-stars around the Galactic center gathered in the last 28 yr imply that Sgr A* hosts
a supermassive compact object of about 4 × 106 M(cid:12), a result awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics 2020. A
non-rotating black hole (BH) nature of Sgr A* has been uncritically adopted since the S-star orbits agree with
Schwarzschild geometry geodesics. The orbit of S2 has served as a test of General Relativity predictions such as the
gravitational redshift and the relativistic precession. The central BH model is, however, challenged by the G2 post-
peripassage motion and by the lack of observations on event-horizon-scale distances robustly pointing to its univocal
presence. We have recently shown that the S2 and G2 astrometry data are better ﬁtted by geodesics in the spacetime
of a self-gravitating dark matter (DM) core – halo distribution of 56 keV-fermions, “darkinos”, which also explains
the outer halo Galactic rotation curves. This Letter conﬁrms and extends this conclusion using the astrometry data
of the 17 best-resolved S-stars, thereby strengthening the alternative nature of Sgr A* as a dense core of darkinos.

1 INTRODUCTION

The gravitational potential in the Galactic Center (GC) is
dominated by a supermassive compact object, Sagittarius
A* (Sgr A*), long thought to be a massive black hole BH
of ≈ 4 × 106 M(cid:12) (Ghez et al. 2005, 2008; Genzel et al. 2010;
Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018b). From the observational
viewpoint, this inference on the nature of Sgr A* mainly
comes from the nearly Keplerian orbits of tens of stars belong-
ing to the S-star cluster (Gillessen et al. 2009a, 2017), whose
motions are well described by geodesics in the Schwarzschild
spacetime geometry. The most important S-cluster member is
S2 which, with an orbital period of about 16 yr and a pericen-
ter of about 1500 Schwarzschild radii, has the most-compact
orbit around Sgr A*. The S2 orbit data have allowed to test
General Relativity predictions such as the relativistic redshift
(see, e.g., Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018a; Do et al. 2019)
and precession (see, e.g., Parsa et al. 2017; Gravity Collabo-
ration et al. 2020). However, not every news is good for the
BH model; it is challenged by the G2 motion which cannot
be explained by any geodesics in the BH geometry (Plewa
et al. 2017; Gillessen et al. 2019), as well as by very scarce
data at event-horizon-scale distances from Sgr A*, robustly
pointing to a univocal central BH presence (see, e.g., Yuan
& Narayan 2014; Bouﬀard et al. 2019).

In view of the above, we have dived into the possibility
of an alternative nature for Sgr A* based on the fermionic
DM proﬁle predicted by the Ruﬃni-Argüelles-Rueda (RAR)
model (Ruﬃni et al. 2015; Argüelles et al. 2018). In the
RAR model, the DM distribution in galaxies is obtained
from the general relativity ﬁeld equations, assuming it as a
self-gravitating system of fermions at ﬁnite temperature in
equilibrium, and distributed in phase-space according to the
Fermi-Dirac statistics including a particle energy cutoﬀ which
gives to the conﬁguration a ﬁnite size (see Argüelles et al.
2018, for more details). We hereafter refer to these neutral,
massive DM fermions as “darkinos”. The RAR model leads
to a dense core – diluted halo density proﬁle in which the
darkinos are: 1) in a quantum degenerate regime within the
nearly uniform core, 2) followed by an intermediate quantum-
classical regime in the density falloﬀ and plateau phase, and
3) ﬁnally in a Boltzmann regime in the outer halo that fol-
lows a power-law density ending with a nearly exponential
cutoﬀ deﬁning the galaxy border. There is a bunch of astro-
physical consequences of the core – halo proﬁle of darkinos
derived from the RAR model. In Argüelles et al. (2018), it
has been shown that it explains the rotation curves of the
Milky Way outer halo. In Argüelles et al. (2019), this agree-
ment has been shown to apply as well to other galaxy types
ranging from dwarfs to big ellipticals and galaxy clusters.
These results have further enticed attention on the darki-
nos microphysics, e.g. their self-interactions (Argüelles et al.
2016; Yunis et al. 2020a) and interaction with neutrinos (Pe-

L2

nacchioni et al. 2020); as well as in their macrophysics, e.g.
their lensing properties (Gómez et al. 2016), their inﬂuence in
the dynamics of binaries (Gómez & Rueda 2017), their halo
formation and stability on cosmological timescales (Argüelles
et al. 2020), and their role in the large and small scale struc-
ture formation (Yunis et al. 2020b).

Having recalled the overall features of the darkinos of the
RAR model, we turn now back to the topic of this Letter.
We have shown in Becerra-Vergara et al. (2020) that, for
darkinos of 56 keV rest mass-energy, the spacetime geometry
produced by the dense quantum core leads to geodesics which
ﬁt equally good, and deﬁnitely superior, respectively, the ob-
servational data of S2 and G2. This result has given a ﬁrst
observational support to the darkinos alternative nature of
Sgr A*. Our aim here is to go a step further, and extend our
previous analysis to the up-to-date astrometry data of the 17
best-resolved S-stars (Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al. 2009b,
2017). In this way, we are testing the models with a more ro-
bust sample composed of a statistically signiﬁcant number of
stars with well-determined positions and velocities. This con-
siderably improves our previous test with S2 complemented
by the object G2 which is of a questioned nature (see, e.g.,
Witzel et al. 2014; Ciurlo et al. 2020). We show below that
the novel results here presented conﬁrm and strengthen the
alternative nature of Sgr A* as a dense core of darkinos.

2 GEODESICS AND ASTROMETRY DATA FIT
The monitoring of the S-stars around Sgr A* provides crucial
knowledge about the properties of the gravitational potential
of the massive object hosted by Sgr A*. One of the most in-
teresting S-stars is S2, whose orbit determination is less prone
to errors being it the brightest. It describes a nearly elliptical
orbit with one of the shortest orbital periods (≈ 16 yr; see e.g.
Ghez et al. 2003; Gillessen et al. 2017; Gravity Collaboration
et al. 2018a), with its pericenter being the second closest to
Sgr A*, rp(S2) ≈ 0.6 mpc. Therefore, S2 provides the most
accurate constraints on the gravitational potential of Sgr A*
to date (Gillessen et al. 2009b, 2017; Ghez et al. 2008).

We here follow the treatment described in Appendices A
and C of Becerra-Vergara et al. (2020) for the best ﬁtting
procedure of S2 and G2, which has been used to constrain
the model parameters in the two scenarios: the BH case and
the (RAR) DM-core case. In the former, the relevant pa-
rameter associated with the source of the gravitational ﬁeld
is the BH mass (MBH), and in the latter, the DM core mass
(Mc). The value of Mc depends on the (underlying) free RAR-
parameters, including the darkino mass m (Argüelles et al.
2018), but the reduced-χ2 minimization here applied to ﬁt the
orbits, following Becerra-Vergara et al. (2020), only uses Mc.
For each Mc value applied in this procedure, the set of un-
derlying free RAR model parameters is such that the overall
core – halo RAR proﬁle better ﬁts the Galaxy rotation curve
(see Appendix A of Becerra-Vergara et al. 2020 for further
details). Then, we solve the full general relativistic equations
of motion of a test particle in the set spacetime geometry
and obtain the real geodesic which, projected onto the sky
plane, best ﬁt the apparent stellar orbit. At any given time,
this is given by the measurements of the right ascension (X)
and declination (Y ). For a ﬁxed model, the real orbit is de-
termined once values of the energy and angular momentum

X is right ascension and Y is declination. The black dashed curves
correspond to the BH model and the colored curves to the RAR
model of darkinos. We refer to table 1 for the orbital parameters

per unit mass of the geodesic are given. They can be deter-
mined using the eﬀective potential technique as described in
Becerra-Vergara et al. (2020), by setting values for the peri-
center and apocenter radii, rp and ra. Alternatively, rp and
ra could be replaced by the semi-major axis a and eccentric-
ity e of an eﬀective ellipse. The values of rp and ra are not
aﬀected in the projection of the orbit onto the sky plane, so
the apparent orbit is then determined for given values of the
osculating orbital elements, i.e. ω, i, and Ω, respectively, the
argument of pericenter, the inclination between the real or-
bit and the sky plane, and the ascending node angle. With
this, the orbital period P and the time of closest approach
to the GC, i.e. the time to reach the pericenter, tp (in J2000
time convention; see Becerra-Vergara et al. 2020 for details),
can be also inferred. Constant position oﬀsets X0 and Y0 are
also introduced to account for the relative position of the
gravitational center of mass to the reference frame (see Eq.
C12 in Becerra-Vergara et al. 2020, and references therein).
The procedure is performed in an iterative fashion to obtain
the best-ﬁt parameters from least squares minimization. In
Becerra-Vergara et al. (2020), the application of this proce-
dure to the case of S2 led to MBH = 4.075 × 106 M(cid:12), in the
BH model, and Mc = 3.5 × 106 M(cid:12), in the RAR model. This

Mc value together with the overall rotation curve ﬁt, implied
the minimum allowed darkino mass, mc2 = 56 keV, fulﬁll-
ing all observational constraints. For this mass, the DM core
radius is rc ≈ 0.4 mpc (Becerra-Vergara et al. 2020). Larger
darkino masses (up to 345 keV), for the same Mc, imply more
compact DM core sizes down to a few Schwarzschild radii, still
satisfying the rotation curve data (Argüelles et al. 2018).

We emphasize the reliability of our ﬁtting procedure. Our
inferred value of MBH in the BH case, using the S2 data,
agrees with the most recently reported values, e.g. MBH =
4.1 × 106 M(cid:12) by Gravity Collaboration et al. (2018a), and
3.975 × 106 M(cid:12) by Do et al. (2019). We here extend the ap-
plication of our model, previously tested with S2 and G2,
to the other S-stars. We apply the above procedure keeping
ﬁxed the above parameters since they deﬁne the source of
0 = −0.0830 and
the gravitational ﬁeld. Likewise, we ﬁx X BH

search for the parameters that determine the real orbit and
best ﬁt the apparent one. We analyze the 17 best-resolved
S-stars S1, S2, S4, S8, S9, S12, S13, S14, S17, S18, S19, S21,
S24, S31, S38, S54, and S55 (Gillessen et al. 2017).

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Table 1 summarizes the best-ﬁt model parameters and the
corresponding reduced-χ2 for the position (X and Y ) and
the line-of-sight radial velocity (i.e. the redshift function z),
for the central BH and the RAR DM models. We can see that,
overall, the RAR model performs slightly better than the BH
model. An estimate of the performance can be obtained by
calculating the average of the averages, namely to sum up
the values of the last column of table 1, and divide it by
the sample number. For the RAR model, this estimate leads
to 1.5741, and for the BH model, 1.6273. This conﬁrms their
comparable accuracy in describing the S-stars data, being the
RAR model of darkinos slightly preferred.

We can gain information on the reliability of our ﬁtting
procedure by comparing the inferred parameters in the BH
case. We have recalled in section 2 that our BH mass inference
using S2 data agrees with most of the recent values reported
in the literature using the same object. In addition, it also
agrees with the reported value obtained from the simultane-
ous ﬁt of several stellar orbits: Boehle et al. (2016) reported
MBH = (4.02 ± 0.16) × 106 M(cid:12) using S2 and S38, and Parsa
et al. (2017) reported MBH = (4.15 ± 0.13) × 106 M(cid:12) using
S2, S38, and S55. This is further conﬁrmed by the fact that,
our inferred orbital parameters for the BH model (see ta-
ble 1), do not diﬀer by more than 2 % for S2, 1 % for S38 and
3 % for S55 from the values reported in Parsa et al. (2017).
Our inferred value of MBH is also within the window reported
in Gillessen et al. (2017), MBH = (4.28 ± 0.21) × 106 M(cid:12), for
the 17 S-stars. While these estimates of MBH in the existing
literature used Post-Newtonian approximations, our method
is fully general relativistic (see Becerra-Vergara et al. 2020).
Having said this, we can turn to the visualization of the
orbits. Figure 1 shows the data and a comprehensive plot of
the best-ﬁt of the observed orbits of the sample of 17 S-stars,
including the stars with the most compact orbits (S2, S38,
and S55). The similar performance of the RAR and BH mod-
els is evident, being their diﬀerences almost indistinguishable

at these scales. In ﬁg. 2, we present the data and the best-ﬁt
of the time evolution of the star position components, X(t)
and Y (t), as well as the redshift function, z(t), for the S-
star sample. Also in this case, the similar performance of the
two tested models is evident. This is particularly relevant be-
cause that a model provides an accurate ﬁt of the orbit, i.e.
of X vs. Y , does not necessarily imply that it correctly ﬁts
its time evolution, namely the model must correctly predict
the observed star motion. Therefore, as described in Becerra-
Vergara et al. (2020), the estimation of the goodness of the
ﬁt must compare the theoretical values of X, Y and z with
the measured values at each observational time.

Summarizing, this Letter shows for the ﬁrst time that a
highly dense concentration of DM particles sited at the GC
can explain the dynamics of the S-stars with similar (and
some cases better) accuracy compared to a central BH model.
These results strengthen the alternative nature of Sgr A* as a
dense quantum core of darkinos superseding the central mas-
sive BH scenario. There is the key additional fact that this
very same core – halo distribution of 56 keV darkinos also
explains the rotation curves of the Milky Way (see Argüelles
et al. 2018; Becerra-Vergara et al. 2020, for details). For parti-
cle masses ∼ 100 keV, the core radius shrinks from 0.4 mpc to
a few Schwarzschild radii, so the gravitational potential pro-
duced by a central BH of mass MBH and a (RAR) DM core of
mass Mc = MBH, practically coincide for r (cid:38) 10 GMBH/c2
(Gómez et al. 2016). Therefore, the dynamics of baryonic
matter at these scales should not diﬀer much in the two sce-
narios. This becomes relevant for the dynamics of objects in
the vicinity of Sgr A*, e.g. the recently detected hot-spots
claimed to move in a circular orbit of 7–23 GMBH/c2 radius
(Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018b; Matsumoto et al. 2020).
However, this wide range of values shows how the inferred
real orbit is strongly aﬀected by model assumptions and the
relatively poor quality of the spots astrometry data, which
is not comparable with the S-stars data here used. The dy-
namics of these spots remain an interesting target for future
investigation as the quantity and quality of the data improve.
In this line, the recent observations of a new set of S-stars
(S62, S4711–S4714), possibly reaching pericenter distances
∼ 400 GMBH/c2 (Peißker et al. 2020a,b), could also oﬀer
the possibility to further constrain the DM core size around
Sgr A*, likewise the lower limit of the darkino mass.

We would like to outline some additional astrophysical and
cosmological consequences of the core – halo distribution of
darkinos in the RAR model. First, it has been shown in
Argüelles et al. (2019) that the DM RAR proﬁles are Uni-
versal, thereby can be also successfully applied to dwarfs,
ellipticals, and galaxy clusters, for m ≈ 50 keV. Second, a
crucial question that arises is whether or not a DM pro-
ﬁle with this morphology can be formed in a cosmological
framework. Importantly, it has been recently demonstrated
in Argüelles et al. (2020) that such core – halo proﬁles are
natural outcomes within non-linear structure formation in
warm DM cosmologies, when the fermionic (quantum) na-
ture of the DM particles is accounted for. It has been there
shown that these novel DM proﬁles are either thermodynam-
ically and dynamically stable for the lifetime of the Universe,
or eventually collapse into a supermassive BH if a critical
(threshold) mass of the quantum core is reached. This pro-
vides a new appealing scenario for the formation, starting
from a DM seed, of the supermassive BHs observed in ac-
