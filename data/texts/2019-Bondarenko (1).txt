In this note, we discuss the hypothesis of a presence of the negative mass matter in
the Schwarzschild’s spacetime and demonstrate, that the discrete P T transformation
of the coordinates and mass inversion in the Schwarzschild’s metric solution is equiv-
alent to the inversion of the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates [M. D. Kruskal, Phys. Rev.
119, 1743 (1960); G. Szekeres, Publ. Mat. Debrecen 7, 285 (1960)], in the full region of
the solution’s spacetime. As the consequence of the result, it is argued that the whole
Schwarzschild spacetime can be described in terms of regions of positive and negative
masses interconnected by the discrete transforms.

Keywords: General relativity; Schwarzschild spacetime; negative mass.

1. Introduction

The motivation of the negative mass gravitation scenario in the diﬀerent cosmologi-
cal models is very clear. In any scenario, see Refs. 2 and 3 for example, the presence
of some kind of repulsive gravitation forces in our Universe helps with explanation
of the existence of dark energy and dark matter in the models, see Refs. 4–8 and
references therein. There are few possibilities to introduce the gravitational repul-
sive force to the scene. In the scenario of Ref. 2, it is argued that the repulsive
gravitation is arising between matter and antimatter (in the sense of charge) parti-
cles without an introduction of any negative masses. It is also possible to consider a
model where our Universe antimatter has a negative mass, see, for example Ref. 3,
where the negative mass extension of Kerr’s solution is populated by our world
antiparticles which possess not positive but negative masses. Additionally, we can
consider the negative mass particles as the antiparticles of the regular ones with
the mass sign of them changed from positive to negative in comparison to the mass

sign of the particles and antiparticles of our Universe. In this case, the annihilation
between the particles of two types of the matter will happen for the particles of
any charge. Important, that the gravitation properties of this matter is also de-
scribed by Einstein equations after the discrete symmetry transformations applied,
see Refs. 2 or 3 and 9 for the discrete symmetries applications in the case of the
quantum and classical systems.

The presence of this type of negative mass antimatter as well explains the
existence of dark energy in our Universe and in this note we discuss the possi-
ble window for the presence of this type of the matter in the spacetime solution
given by Schwarzschild’s metric. The consideration is based on the following main
statements.

(1) An assumption about the full symmetry between isolated behavior of the posi-
tive and negative mass matter. Namely, in the absence of our, “normal”, matter,
the negative mass matter behaves as the usual one, i.e. it has the positive iner-
tial mass and mutual attraction sign in Newton’s gravitation law in the weak
ﬁeld approximation, see Ref. 11. As the consequence of this request, in the
given framework, we have to reproduce the usual Schwarzschild metric solution
in the regions with the negative mass present.

(2) The anti-gravity assumption about the interaction of positive and negative
masses which means that the interaction of the matter and antimatter is due
to the repulsion force, i.e. with repulsion in the weak ﬁeld approximation.

(3) The uniﬁed description assumption. Both solutions for diﬀerent masses must
be encoded in the same Einstein’s equations, similarly, for example, to the
particle–antiparticle interpretation of the solutions of QFT equations. This
statement does not mean only the invariance of the equation under the CPT
transformation and mass inversion. It postulates that both solutions of positive
and negative masses are present in the whole spacetime which is deﬁned in
terms of some suitable coordinate system, Kruskal–Szekeres for example. For
the Schwarzschild spacetime it means that both solutions are subject to the
same solution of the general relativity equations. Therefore, any transforms
of the interests do not pull out the solutions from the spacetime deﬁned by
this way.

The last request clariﬁes that we do not consider any bi-metric theories of the
gravity as in Refs. 4 and 10 but mainly try to follow the ideas of Refs. 2 and 3
with, nevertheless, a diﬀerent interpretation of what provides the possible repulsive
gravitational forces in our Universe.

The ﬁrst two properties of the matter and antimatter can be explained through
the application of the CPT symmetry transformation to the Einstein equations,
see Refs. 2 and 3. It can be understood as a consequence of the physics law in-
variance under the transform. Namely, introducing gravitational source and probe
masses in the problem, the equations of motion of the source masses of diﬀerent
signs will be the same whereas the relative sign in the Newton’s gravitation law

will be diﬀerent when it is applied for the probe and source masses of the diﬀerent
signs. Correspondingly, the third statement above can be considered as a condition
of the self-consistency of the negative mass hypothesis. So far, there are no any
experimental facts about a non-correctness of the general relativity results or pre-
dictions. Therefore, it looks natural to check the possibility of the negative masses
presence in any solution of Einstein equations, beginning from Schwarzschild’s met-
ric solution. If no contradictions in the construction of the negative mass scenario
in the present framework are found, then can be considered as some veriﬁcation of
the possibility of its existence, which, of course, does not prove the reality of the
negative mass. In any case, only experimental checks of the hypothesis can prove
or disprove it. Therefore, the main goal of the note is a check of the possibility to
reveal the negative mass solution in the spacetime determined by the Schwarzschild
solution. In Sec. 2, we discuss Schwarzschild’s metric solution in its transformation
in the proposed framework and Sec. 3 concludes the paper with the representation
of the discussion of possible consequences of the hypothesis.

2. Schwarzschild Metric and Negative Mass Spacetime

The easiest way to understand the negative mass structure of the Schwarzschild
metric is to consider the metric in the Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates. For
the ongoing Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates (v , r, t), which describe the met-
ric structure in I–II regions (see the deﬁnitions in Ref. 12 for example), we have as
usual

Correspondingly, the outgoing Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates (u, r, t) describe
the solution in III–IV regions, the metric there has the following form:

see Ref. 12. Now, we would like to continue the metric in the region of negative
masses performing a substitution M → − ˜M , ˜M > 0. Nevertheless, this naive con-
tinuation is not correct, the particles of negative masses must preserve the same
dynamics as the “normal” ones. Therefore, the time and radial coordinate must be
reversed as well in order to preserve the horizon properties of Schwarzschild’s black
hole solution: t → −˜t, ˜t > 0 and r → −˜r, ˜r > 0, see Refs. 2 and 3. The new variables
cover the same R1 region as the “normal” ones, and now we can construct the full

spherically symmetrical vacuum spacetime in Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates accu-
rately performing the discrete transforms. Consider ﬁrst the U < 0, V > 0 region
(the region I with r > 2M ) of the (U, V ) coordinate plane. We have there

U = −e−u/4M ,

V = ev /4M .

Now, in order to continue this quadrant of the space in the region of negative mass,
we perform the discrete transforms. For the incoming coordinate, we obtain

v = t + r∗ → ˜v = −˜t − ˜r + 2M

after the ﬁnal reversion of the mass. For the outgoing coordinate, we will have
similarly

u = t − r∗ → ˜u = −(cid:4)

+ 4ıπ ˜M = −u + 4ıπ ˜M .

Therefore, the continuation of Eq. (5) coordinates in the region of negative mass
will have the following form:

U = −e−u/4M → ˜U = e−˜u/4 ˜M = −U,
V = ev /4M → ˜V = −e−˜v/4 ˜M = −V.

This inversion of the signs of the (U, V ) coordinate axes will hold correspondingly in
all regions of (U, V ) plane after analytical continuation, Eqs. (7) and (8). Formally,
from the point of view of the discrete transform performed in (U, V ) plane, the
transformations Eq. (9) are equivalent to the full reversion of the Kruskal–Szekeres

of the complete Schwarzschild spacetime. The spacetime with ( ˜U , ˜V ) variables,
obtained after the applied discrete transforms, must be understood as spacetime
with these “watching point” in the regions of the negative mass. Therefore, the
region I in the ( ˜U , ˜V ) plane corresponds to the region III in (U, V ) plane, the
“white hole” region, IV in the space of normal mass, will transform to the black
hole region, II, in the ( ˜U , ˜V ) coordinate plane and vice versa. Importantly, both

spaces of normal and negative masses are encoded in the same solution of the
Einstein equation in correspondence to our third proposition.

3. Conclusions

In this short note, we discuss the possibility of the presence of the negative mass
matter in the world as described by Schwarzschild spacetime. Basing on the three
statements above, see Sec. 1, we obtained that regions III–IV of the Schwarzschild’s
metric solution in Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates, disconnected from our “normal”
world, can be interpreted as the regions populated by the matter of the negative
mass. This result is clariﬁed by the demonstration that the application of the in-
version of the mass, radial coordinate and time reversing in the Schwarzschild’s
metric solution is equivalent to the full inverse of the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates
in whole spacetime determined by Schwarzschild’s metric, which is the most im-
portant result of this note. In our future research, we plan to investigate whether
this result can be justiﬁed in the case of more complex symmetrical solutions of
Einstein equations as well, see Refs. 12 and 13.

The ﬁrst important consequence of the obtained result is that the regions of
the negative mass are disconnected from the spacetime of “normal” mass, see, for
example Ref. 14. Namely, with the Schwarzschild’s metric as the solution of the
Einstein equations, there is no direct connection between the regions populated by
the negative and “normal” masses. Nevertheless, in this scenario, the white holes
in our part of the spacetime are inverted into the black holes which consist of the
mass of another type, this is the only sign of the negative masses in our part of
the full spacetime for the case of Schwarzschild’s solution, see also Ref. 13. The
inﬂuence of these “negative” black holes on the “normal” matter is in the repulsion
of the matter around, no other signals can be detected from the objects. Taking
into account that the negative mass scenario is proposed to explain the dark energy
presence in our universe, we conclude that in the given framework the dark energy
can correspond to the mass of the “negative” black holes in the negative mass region
of the spacetime. Another interesting observation is a possibility of modiﬁcations
and extensions of some non-canonical theories of cosmology in the spacetime with
negative mass present, see Refs. 15 and 16.

In conclusion, we underline that any proposed scenario of the negative mass
existing has to explain the features of our region of spacetime and any cosmologi-
cal properties of the observed universe without redundant modiﬁcation of existing
theories and it must be veriﬁed in both theoretical and experimental ways. In our
opinion, further work in this direction is a very intriguing and interesting subject
of research.
