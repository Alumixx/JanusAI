Physical	and	mathematical	inconsistancy	of	the	black	holes	models.		

	

The	alternative	of	the	plugstars	model.	

_____________________________________________________________________________________________	
Abstract	:		
				We	review	the	different	points	on	which	the	black	hole	model	is	based,	showing	in	
particular	that	the	metric	extension	of	Kruskal	relies	on	an	irregular	change	of	variable,	
associated	to	the	hypothesis	that	zero	raised	to	the	zero	power	is	equal	to	unity.	The	
naive	obsession	with	the	contractibility	of	space	leads	the	black	hole	designers	to	a	real	
geometrical	aberration	consisting	in	considering	that	inside	the	object	the	variables	of	
time	and	space	see	their	roles	exchanged,	whereas	a	structure	equipped	with	a	throat	
sphere	avoids	this	choice.	We	show	that	a	re-reading	of	the	inner	Schwarzschild	solution,	
combined	with	the	choice	of	another	time	coordinate	admitting	the	presence	of	a	cross	
term	in	drdt,	leads	to	the	consideration	of	a	one-way	membrane,	as	a	communication	
interface	between	two	Lorentzian	spacetimes	through	which	matter	transits	in	a	finite	
time,	which	invalidates	the	treatment	of	the	outer	Schwarzschild	solution	as	a	freeze-
frame	of	a	very	fast	process.	Taking	into	account	the	inner	Schwarzschild	solution,	
where	a	physical	criticality	occurs	before	the	geometrical	criticality	shows	that	this	
results	in	a	local	inversion,	at	the	center	of	the	object,	of	the	time	variable	and	the	mass	
of	the	particles.	This	phenomenon	can	then	be	interpreted	through	the	cosmological	
Janus	model,	this	excess	mass	being	immediately	ejected	from	the	star.	An	alternative	
model,	of	plugstar,	emerges,	presenting	a	gravitational	redshift	of	3,	which	fits	with	the	
data	collected	for	the	hypermassive	objects	of	M87	and	the	Milky	Way.	We	predict	that	
this	same	value	will	accompany	similar	images	collected	in	the	future.

1	–	Introduction.		
				Today,	the	existence	of	stellar	or	giant	black	holes	is	considered	as	an	established	fact	
[1].	But	what	do	we	see	on	the	two	images,	presented	in	false	colors,	of	hypermassive	
objects	located	at	the	center	of	the	galaxy	M87	and	the	Milky	Way,	immediately	qualified	
as	giant	black	holes?	Just	a	ring	of	greater	brightness,	surrounding	a	dark	spot.	In	the	
article,	below	the	image	on	the	left	of	figure	1,	there	is	a	bar	to	link	the	chromatic	
intensity	to	a	brightness	temperature,	where	black	codes	have	a	value	close	to	zero,	
while	a	very	bright	yellow,	tending	to	white,	indicates	a	maximum	brightness	
temperature	reaching	6	billion	degrees.	Thanks	to	a	set	of	radiotelescopes	the	images	
below	have	been	reconstructed.

Brightness	temperature	measurements.	Ratio	Tmax/Tmin:	3.	

Figure	1:	Images	of	the	objects	at	the	center	of	M87	and	the	Milky	Way.	

	
					It	turns	out	that	the	human	eye	perceives	the	chromatic	differences	with	precision.	
Using	it	as	a	measuring	instrument,	if	the	brightness	temperature	of	the	environment	is	
found	to	be	in	the	range	of	zero,	this	is	far	from	being	the	case	for	the	central	part	of	the	
object	in	the	figure	on	the	left,	representing	the	object	at	the	center	of	M87,	which	leads	
to	a	value	of	around	1.9	billion	degrees,	with	the	maximum	temperature,	in	the	ring,	
reaching	5.7	billion	Kelvin.	Although	the	authors	of	the	article	add	"that	the	value	of	the	
brightness	temperature	measured	should	not	be	immediately	identified	with	a	
temperature	of	the	plasma	surrounding	the	object",	we	are	still	entitled	to	think	that	
there	is	a	strong	correlation	between	the	two.	Let's	move	on	to	the	object	in	the	figure	
on	the	right,	representing	the	object	Sgr	A*,	in	the	center	of	the	Milky	Way.	Minimum	
temperature	4	billion	degrees.	Maximum	temperature	12	billion	degrees.		
Here	again	the	ratio	of	the	maximum	to	minimum	brightness	temperature	is	3.		
						If	we	refer	to	the	synthetic	images	of	black	holes,	based	on	the	numerous	simulations	
carried	out,	a	much	higher	brightness	temperature	contrast	should	be	observed,	
whatever	the	angle	from	which	it	is	observed.	
				The	black	hole	model	was	built	from	an	exact	solution	[2],	published	in	1916	by	the	
German	mathematician	Karl	Schwarzschild	of	the	particular	form,	without	second	
member,	referring	to	an	empty	portion	of	the	universe,	of	the	equation	found	by	
A.Einstein	a	few	months	earlier	[3].		It	is	of	major	importance	to	keep	in	mind	the	
conditions	under	which	Scharzcshild	makes	this	calculation.	All	quantities	are	real:	the	
coordinates	and	the	value	of	the	length	s.	Schwarzschild	starts	with	a	Cartesian

coordinate	system,	then	moves	to	a	representation	introducing	the	real	and	positive	
scalar	r	:

treating	this	quantity	R	as	a	radial	variable,	has	produced	a	chimera,	which	has	become	
the	black	hole	model.	Today,	specialists	are	either	not	aware	of	this	error,	or	they	refuse	
to	consider	it.	
			It	is	impossible	to	understand	how	such	a	gross	and	damaging	mistake	could	have	
been	made	after	the	Second	World	War,	more	than	half	a	century	ago,	if	one	does	not	
accurately	retrace	the	history	of	what	is	considered	today	as	cosmological	science.	
	2	–	Historical	review	
				In	1916	the	mathematician	Karl	Schwarzschild	started	from	the	field	equation	that	
Albert	Einstein	had	just	constructed	[3]	in	1915	and	thanks	to	which	Einstein	was	able	
to	construct	a	stationary,	linearized	solution	[4]	of	his	equation,	when	the	second	
member	is	zero,	i.e.	referring	to	a	portion	of	empty	space-time.	From	this	solution,	
expressed	as	a	metric,	Einstein	was	able	to	produce	geodesics	by	proposing	that	the	
planets	follow	these	curves.	
			From	the	linearized	solution	that	he	built	and	published	Einstein	found	the	explanation	
of	the	phenomenon	of	the	advance	of	the	perihelion	of	the	planet	Mercury.	He	then	
sends	the	whole	of	these	results	to	Karl	Schwarzschild	who	is	then	in	cantonment	on	the	
Eastern	front,	the	Russian	front.	As	a	mathematician,	well	versed	in	physics	and	
astronomy,	he	mastered	the	new	tools	of	differential	geometry.	He	immediately	
understood	the	significance	of	Einstein's	work.			
			He	then	immediately	considered	completing	them	by	aiming	at	a	complete	modeling	of	
the	problem	in	terms	of	physics.		He	decides	to	represent	the	source	of	the	field,	the	
stars,	the	Sun,	as	spheres	filled	with	an	incompressible	fluid	of	constant	density	ρo.	He	
then	constructs,	still	under	the	assumption	of	stationarity,	the	two	geometrical	solutions,	
in	a	non-linear	form	[5]	,	describing	:	
-  The	geometry	outside	the	star,	in	the	form	of	a	metric	solution	that	we	will	
designate	by	 
(ext)		
-  The	geometry	inside	the	star,	in	the	form	of	a	metric	solution	that	we	will	
designate	by	 
(int)		
				He	undertakes	to	construct	his	solutions	in	a	system	of	coordinates	 
}.	At	
no	time	does	he	refer	to	the	world	of	complexes.	These	coordinates	are	real,	as	is	the	
length	element	s,	the	key	to	this	geometric	description.	He	quickly	switches	to	polar	
coordinates	 
}.	See	figure	1.		The	quantity	r	is	therefore	automatically	real	and	
positive.		
					He	ensures	the	compatibility	of	these	two	solutions	by	giving	the	conditions	of	
connection	of	the	two	geometrical	systems,	on	the	sphere.

					His	first	goal	is	to	match	the	result	of	Albert	Einstein	[4]	,	for	whom	he	has	a	deep	
admiration.	His	goal	is	not	to	explore	the	ins	and	outs	of	the	solutions	he	has	constructed	
but	to	link	his	results,	in	their	linearized	form,	with	Einstein's.							
						The	non-linear	version	of	these	solutions	does	not	seem	to	him	to	be	of	interest	in	
physics,	insofar	as	the	characteristic	radius,	which	he	calls	α	,	to	which	we	will	give	his	
name,	the	Schwarzschild	radius	Rs,	turns	out	to	be	very	small	compared	to	the	radius	of	
the	star	(which	he	evaluates	at	3	km	in	the	case	of	the	Sun,	as	does	Einstein).	
				He	therefore	does	not	explicitly	present	his	metric	solution.	He	just	put	it	in	a	suitable	
form	in	order	to	fit	Einstein’s	approximate	linear	result,	in	a	letter	to	Einstein,	through	a	
particular	formulation,	in	spherical	coordinates,	expressed	using	an	intermediate	
variable	R,	corresponding	to	 R = ( r3 + α3)1/3	.	When	r	is	large	in	front	of	α	this	quantity	R	
differs	from	r	by	a	negligible	amount.	The	expression	of	the	metric	using	this	coordinate	
system	 
} implying R > α			thus	allows,	in	the	simplest	way,	an	identification	
with	Einstein's	linearized	solution.		
					And	it	is	in	this	form	that	Schwarzschild	presents	his	result	in	his	article	of	January	
1916	[3].	See	figure	1.	Below	is	an	excerpt	from	his	paper	where	he	presents	his	
solution	:

				Note	the	German	word	Hilfsgröβe,	which	translates	as:	"intermediate	quantity".	The	
succession	of	signs	of	the	terms	(	+	-	-	-	)	constitutes	what	will	later	be	called	the	
signature	of	the	metric.	In	this	formulation,	it	is	clear	that	if	the	coordinates	have	real	
values,	so	does	the	quantity		if		R	>	α.			
					In	fact,	this	is	what	Schwarzschild	should	have	written,	if	he	had	wanted	to	remain	
consistent	with	the	coordinate	system	he	had	chosen	from	the	start.

				Schwarzschild	immediately	notes	that	for	a	value	 cosχa=	1/3	this	magnitude	becomes	
infinite.	For	this	pressure	not	to	rise	to	infinity	at	the	center	of	the	star,	the	radius	of	the	
star,	for	a	given	density,	must	satisfy	:	
(6)																		 
					In	fact	of	rise	of	the	pressure	in	the	center	towards,	it	is	rather	a	rise	of	the	volumic	
density	of	energy	(which	creates	the	curvature).	But	a	pressure	is	also	a	volume	density	
of	energy.	In	a	fluid	the	pressure	is	given	by	  p = (ρ< v2 >) / 3.		At	constant	density,	if	the	
pressure	in	a	fluid	increases,	it	means	that	the	average	thermal	agitation	speed	tends	to	
c	and		  p = ρc2 / 3,	is	then	identified	with	the	radiation	pressure.	At	constant	density	and	
constant	speed	of	light,	this	pressure	is	therefore	limited	by	a	maximum	value.		
					As	Schwarzschild	remains	in	this	hypothesis	of	a	constant	density	 ρo	he	deduces,	as	
mentioned	in	his	article	that	when	the	radius	of	the	star	tends	to	 ˆR,	in	its	center	the	
speed	of	light	becomes	infinite	
	(7)																																				 
c → ∞	
					Historically,	this	is	the	first	mention	of	a	situation	where	the	speed	of	light	can	cease	
to	be	an	absolute	quantity.		The	quantity	α	or	Schwarzschild	radius	Rs	was,	by	an	
identification	based	on	the	Newtonian	approximation	:		
(8)																													 
ˆR 2	
					In	the	outer	metric,	the	presence	of	the	term	  − dR 2 / (1− α / R)suggests	that	a	
geometric	criticality	may	occur	when	R	tends	to	the	Schwarzschild	radius.	This	one	is	
proportional	to	the	mass	M,	thus	to	the	cube	of	the	radius	of	the	star,	at	constant	density.	
(9)																																									 
																											
					When	the	radius	Ra	of	the	star	becomes	equal	to	the	Schwarzschild	radius	Rs,	it	
reaches	the	value	:		
(10)																																																																		 
which	happens	to	be	the	value	of	the	radius	 ˆR,	which	depends	only	on	the	density.	It	is	
by	focusing	on	this	idea	of	geometric	criticality	that	astrophysicists	will	evaluate	the

maximum	mass	of	a	neutron	star,	assimilated	to	a	star	of	constant	density	 ρo,	whereas	it	
is	quite	clear	from	Karl	Schwarzschild's	second	paper	that	a	 physical	criticality	would	
manifest	itself	before	this	value	is	reached.	But	before	considering	these	considerations,	
let	us	return	to	the	historical	aspects.		
					Karl	Schwarzschild	died	of	an	infection	a	few	months	after	publishing	his	two	papers.		
				Being	fluent	in	German,	the	young	Robert	Oppenheimer,	who	came	from	a	wealthy	
family,	completed	his	studies	at	the	University	of	Göttingen,	the	Mecca	of	theoretical	
science	in	the	years	1900-1920.	There	he	defended	in	1927	a	doctoral	thesis	under	the	
direction	of	Max	Born,	focused	on	quantum	mechanics,	which	had	nothing	to	do	with	
general	relativity	
					At	the	beginning	of	1933	Einstein	stayed	outside	Germany.	He	learned	that	his	house	
had	been	looted	by	the	Nazis	and	decided	not	to	return	to	Germany.	At	the	invitation	of	
Abraham	Flexner,	founder	of	the	Institute	for	Advanced	Study	in	Princeton,	he	
emigrated	to	the	United	States	and	accepted	a	position	at	this	institute,	which	he	held	
until	his	death	in	1955.		
					There	he	had	exchanges	with	the	American	mathematician	and	theoretical	physicist	
Richard	Tolmann,	who	was	also	familiar	with	the	German	language,	which	is	far	from	
being	the	case	for	all	American	scientists.	Tolman,	who	was	52	years	old	at	that	time,	
had	already	a	large	part	of	his	scientific	career	behind	him.	He	became	familiar	with	
German	general	relativity	at	the	same	time	as	Robert	Oppenheimer,	who	also	met	
Einstein.		
				At	that	time	there	was	no	English	translation	of	Schwarzschild's	articles.	The	first	one	
will	be	available	in	this	language	only	in	1975	and	the	second	in	1999.	The	presentation	
made	by	Tolman	in	a	monograph,	in	1934,	thus	takes	the	nature	of	a	first	"bible	of	
general	relativity".	But	in	this	work	the	confusion	between	the	"Schwarzschild	
intermediate	quantity	R"	and	a	radial	coordinate	r	is	realized,	confusion	which	is	also	
that	of	the	mathematician	David	Hilbert.	From	then	on,	what	is	called	the	"Schwarzschild	
metric"	is	identified	with	the	wellknown	expression.	In	the	literature	this	characteristic	
length	is	indifferently	designated	by	Rg	,	Rs	,	2m.		
					Hilbert's	writings	of	1915-1916,	entitled	"Fundamentals	of	Physics"	([6],	[7]),	whose	
English	translations,	still	copyrighted	by	the	German	publisher	Springer	of	works	on	
relativity	and	theoretical	physics,	remain	hardly	accessible,	are	mostly	unknown	to	
theorists.		In	detailing	them,	we	find	the	origin	in	particular	of	the	change	of	signature	
 (+ − − − ) → (− + + + )	which	makes	that	today	we	find	more	commonly	the	form	:	
(11)																																		 
						Let	us	notice	that	by	giving	real	values	to	t	and	r	one	falls	indifferently	on	real	or	
imaginary	pure	values	of	ds.		The	explanation	emerges	when	we	detail	the	writings	of	
Hilbert.	At	the	time	when	he	produced	these	works,	it	was	not	known	that	the	universe	
had	known	"an	instant	zero",	and	that	it	was	evolving.	The	geometry	of	space,	and	
beyond	that	of	space-time,	thus	correspond	to	an	appearance	ex	nihilo,	inspired	by	the	
theme	of	a	biblical	creation	(Hibert	is	a	believer).		For	Hilbert,	what	pre-exists	is	space

[6],	with	its	three	coordinates	and	their	signature	(	+	+	+	).	Then	appears	a	time	variable	
which	he	designates	by	the	letter	l.	The	tangent	metric	of	Hilbert	is	then	:		
(12)																																																								 ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 + dl2	
					To	satisfy	the	requirements	of	special	relativity,	Hilbert	produces	his	own	
interpretation.	While	Einstein's	genius	was	to	understand	that	time	was	only	a	fourth	
dimension	of	the	hypersurface	and	was	initially	measured	in	meters,	for	David	Hilbert	
this	fourth	dimension,	temporal,	is	in	fact	of	a	different	essence,	pure	imaginary:		
(13)																																																																									l	=	i	c	t	
					So	the	tangent	metric	becomes:		
(14)																																																			 ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 − c2dt2		
				This	is	the	origin	of	the	sudden	change	of	this	signature,	in	the	years	after	the	war,	and	
which	ended	up	imposing	itself,	without	one	being	able	to	find	an	article	where	this	
change	is	argued	and	justified	In	fact,	Hilbert	does	not	give	himself	the	metric	in	this	
form,	but	simply	considers	the	bilinear	form:		
gxxdx2 + gyydy2 + gzzdz2 − gt tdt2	
(15)																																																	 
which	he	designates	by	the	letter	G.	He	then	defines	two	"lengths"	[7]	.		When	G	is	
negative,	he	constructs	a	first	length,	positive	and	real	thanks	to	the	introduction	of	a	
minus	sign,	which	is	identified	with	the	proper	time	 τ	of	special	relativity:	
	

	

Fig.	6	:	The	construction	of	the	proper	time,	according	to	D.Hilbert.		

	
					When	G	is	zero,	this	refers	to	geodesics	of	zero	length,	borrowed	by	the	light.	When	G	
is	positive,	it	defines	a	real	length	 λ,	according	to	:

	whose	meaning	remains	unknown	to	this	day.		

Fig.7	:	A	second	length	of	space-time	[7],	defined	by	D.Hilbert	

				Thereafter,	neither	he,	nor	any	of	his	commentators	or	successors	will	mention	this	
"second	real	length"	 λ	of	Hilbert.	But	we	can	suppose	that	he	may	have	had	the	idea	of	
envisaging	a	kind	of	metaphysics	where	this	magnitude	would	have	been	the	
"corresponding	time".	In	any	case,	we	owe	him	this	inversion	of	the	signature	and	the	
fact	that	modern	theorists	have	lost	all	"sense	of	reality"	in	differential	geometry,	the	
expression	used	in	this	case	being	perfectly	adequate	to	the	situation.		In	the	immediate	
post-war	period	the	signatures	(	+	-	-	-	)	and	(	-	+	+	+	)	can	be	found	in	various	writings.	
But	in	1934,	and	before	the	Second	World	War,	it	is	the	signature	(	+	-	-	-	)	that	is	found	
in	all	the	articles,	in	particular	in	Tolman's[8].			As	it	will	be	evoked	later	in	the	works	of	
Flamm	[9]	,	1916	and	Weyl	1917	[10]	(which	will	be	the	subject	of	English	translations	
only	in	2021	and	2015),	some	try	to	see	in	these	solutions	a	way	to	represent	massive	
particles.	With	his	student	Rosen,	Einstein	published	in	1935	a	paper	in	this	direction	
[11],	based	on	a	presentation	of	the	Schwarzschild	solution,	describing	the	vacuum,	with	
other	coordinates.		From	this	emerges	the	idea	of	a	kind	of	"bridge"	between	two	spaces.	
But	the	metric	reformulated	in	this	way	has	the	disadvantage	of	no	longer	being	
identified	with	Lorentz's	metric	to	infinity.	This	concept,	initially	present	in	Flamm	and	
Weyl,	was	taken	up	by	many	authors,	including	C.W.	Misner	and	J.A.	Wheeler	in	1957	
[16].

						From	the	beginning	of	the	century,	astronomy	made	giant	leaps,	linked	to	the	
development	of	spectroscopy	and	the	progress	of	theoretical	physics	and	quantum	
mechanics.	The	energy	source	of	stars	is	identified.	Spectroscopy	provides	precise	
observational	data.	Models	of	stars	and	their	evolutionary	scenarios	are	developed.	In	
the	1930s,	the	American	Fritz	Zwicky	sketches	the	brutal	scenario	that	signals	the	end	of	
life	of	massive	stars	and	invents	the	supernova	model.		
						The	neutron	having	been	discovered	in	1932	by	the	American	Chadwick,	the	
structure	of	the	remnant	resulting	from	such	brutal	ends	of	massive	stars	is	based	on	its	
properties.	The	concept	of	neutron	star	emerges.	In	1939	Robert	Oppenheimer	
publishes	an	article	with	Snyder	[12]	in	which	he	suggests	that	when	the	counter-
pressure	exerted	by	the	neutrons	could	not	counterbalance	the	force	of	gravity,	massive	
stars	could	implode	without	any	other	imitation	than	the	fact	of	seeing	all	the	matter	
converge	towards	a	point,	the	geometric	center	of	a	spherically	symmetric	system.		
					He	tries	to	construct	the	scenario	of	such	an	implosion,	leading	the	matter	to	cross	the	
Schwarzschild	sphere,	deduced	from	the	simple	mass	of	the	star	considered	
					He	then	published	a	second	article	[13],	still	in	1939,	in	connection	with	Tolman,	
where	he	undertook	to	construct	the	relativistic	physics	of	hypermassive	objects,	such	
as	neutron	stars.	In	this	article	we	find	what	will	later	be	called	the	TOV	equation,	for	
Tolman,	Oppenheimer	and	Volkoff,	which	allows	us	to	construct	the	evolution	of	the	
pressure	inside	the	star.	It	turns	out	that	Richard	Tolman	was	the	author	of	a	similar	
work.	But	neither	Oppenheimer	and	Volkoff,	nor	Tolman	mention	the	real	author	of	this	
work:	Karl	Schwarzschild,	in	1916.		
					Indeed	it	is	nothing	else	than	an	identical	reproduction	of	the	solution	published	in	
1916	by	Karl	Schwarzschild	in	his	second	paper	[5].	It	is	easy	to	realize	this	by	applying	
to	his	metric	the	inverse	change	of	variable,	going	from	the	variable	to	the	variable	R	

This	is	the	founding	act	of	the	black	hole	model.

(now	r	in	the	literature).	But	as	nobody	has	read,	or	even	knows	about	the	existence	of	
this	second	solution,	the	deception	goes	unnoticed.		
				On	this	point,	the	Second	World	War	was	an	interlude.	Already	old,	Tolman	left	the	
game	completely	and	died	in	1948	at	the	age	of	67.	Oppenheimer	spends	the	war	years	
working	on	interesting	outdoor	experiments.	In	the	post-war	period,	preoccupied	by	the	
lawsuit	brought	by	those	who	accused	him	of	anti-American	activity,	he	does	not	return	
to	these	questions	of	becoming	stars.		
						Einstein	remains	skeptical	about	the	scenario	proposed	by	Oppenheimer.	Trying	in	
vain	to	extend	his	theory	to	the	"unified	fields",	integrating	in	the	same	geometrical	
context	gravitation	and	electromagnetism,	he	dies	in	1958.	It	is	then	that	a	new	
generation	of	those	who	will	be	called	"cosmologists"	is	born.		
						In	1963	a	New	Zealand	mathematician,	Roy	Kerr,	builds	a	solution	of	Einstein's	
equation	without	a	second	member,	describing	the	vacuum,	always	stationary,	which	is	
no	longer	spherically	symmetric,	but	axisymmetric	[17].	It	thus	seems	more	suitable	to	
describe	astrophysical	objects,	observation	having	confirmed	in	1967	the	existence	of	
neutron	stars,	while	specifying	that	these	objects	are	animated	by	very	rapid	rotations,	
up	to	a	thousand	revolutions	per	second.		
(16)	
	
				The	Kerr	metric	has	this	time	a	cross	term	in	 dt dϕ,	whereas	the	classical	expression	
of	the	Schwarzschild	metric	does	not.	This	particularity	makes	the	speed	of	light,	for	
rays	drawn	tangentially	to	an	orbit-circle,	have	two	different	values,	depending	on	the	
direction	chosen.	This	aspect	is	evoked	by	writing	that,	we	quote		:	
-  Everything	 happens	 as	 if	 the	 source	 of	 the	 field,	 in	 rotation,	 were	 somehow	
space-time	along	in	its	rotational	movement.	(	[19]	ch.	7	).		
				All	this	does	not	go	beyond	the	stage	of	a	simple	remark,	although	it	refers	to	the	idea	
of	the	mathematician	Ernst	Mach,	who	denied	the	reality	of	an	absolute	space,	thinking	
that	space	was	fundamentally	linked	to	matter.	We	will	come	back	to	this	later.	
					In	1965,	for	example,	Ronald	Adler,	Maurice	Bazin	and	Menaheim	Schiffer	published	a	
book	entitled	"Introduction	to	General	Relativity",	published	by	Mac	Graw	Hill,	
integrating	the	"state	of	the	art"	of	the	time	[19].	In	this	book,	we	find	the	constructions	
of	the	exterior	and	interior	metrics.	At	the	end	of	chapter	14	where	this	construction	is	
taken	up	again,	leading	to	"the	famous	TOV	equation",	in	the	1975	edition	the	authors	
quote	Schwarzschild's	second	paper,	from	1916,	without	explaining,	in	the	text,	that	this	
work	is	in	fact	his	own.	It	is	not	known	whether	this	mention	was	already	present	in	the	
1965	edition,	or	even	whether	the	content	of	this	chapter	was	part	of	the	book,	since	the

work	of	one	of	the	authors,	Ronald	Adler,	only	appeared	in	the	specialized	literature	in	
1971	
						In	this	pivotal	period,	between	the	sixties	and	seventies,	the	black	hole	model	was	
built.		The	main	architects	are	the	physicist	John	Archibald	Wheeler,	a	former	member	of	
the	Manathan	project,	and	his	two	students,	Kip	Thorne	[19],	future	Nobel	Prize	winner	
in	2017,	and	Charles	W.	Misner	[16].	Everything	is	set	out	in	a	lavishly	illustrated	book	
entitled	"Gravitation",	published	in	1973.	Enriched	over	the	years	by	numerous	
additions,	it	is	considered	the	reference	work,	reaching	1279	pages	to	date.		
				So	what	was	going	on	at	this	pivotal	time?		
				Wheeler	and	his	collaborators	took	up	Oppenheimer's	seminal	paper	where	most	of	
the	singular	aspects	of	Schwarzschild's	solution,	as	they	thought	it	was	expressed,	were	
evoked.	The	coordinate	r	is	considered	as	a	radial	coordinate.	The	object	thus	has,	they	
thought,	an	exterior	and	an	interior.	An	error	that	persists	today.		
						The	gravitational	redshift	effect	tends	to	infinity,	when	a	mass	sees	its	radius	merging	
with	its	Schwarzschild	sphere.	Beyond	this	point,	it	becomes	impossible	to	construct	a	
scenario	describing	this	matter.	Still,	no	light	can	emerge	from	such	an	"object".	Hence	
the	name	given	to	it	by	Wheeler:	Black	hole.		
					When	we	consider	the	geodesic	path	followed	by	a	witness	mass,	plunging	towards	
this	"object",	it	reaches,	according	to	the	proper	time	s,	its	geometric	center	in	a	finite	
time,	which	Oppenheimer	had	already	located	in	days	in	1939.	On	the	scale	of	geological	
phenomena,	this	is	an	extremely	short	time.		
					On	the	other	hand,	the	proponents	of	such	a	model	base	themselves	on	the	time	
coordinate	used	by	Schwarzschild,	which,	for	them,	is	identified	with	the	own	time	
experienced	by	a	distant	observer.		Such	a	paradox	allows	us	to	use	this	stationary	
solution	to	describe	a	phenomenon	of	extreme	brevity.	The	distant	observer	is	thus	a	
spectator	of	a	phenomenon	which,	for	him,	means	in	infinite	time.	
	2	–	The	question	of	the	expression	of	the	solution	for	r	<	Rs	
						This	question	was	solved	relatively	quickly	in	the	sense	that	the	Kretschman	scalar	
was	not	zero	at	this	point.	A	whole	set	of	different	choices	of	variables	were	successfully	
proposed,	allowing	to	eliminate	this	coordinate	singularity	to	the	point	that	it	is	no	
longer	a	problem	today.	What	remained	was	to	succeed	in	exploring	"the	interior	of	this	
Schwarzschild	sphere".		In	1960	Martin	Kruskal	proposed	a	change	of	coordinates	[18]	
which	claimed	to	be	able	to	make	this	jump.	His	project	is,	starting	from	coordinates	
},	to	pass	to	a	system	  v , u , θ , ϕ
(17)																																									 ds2 = f 2(u,v)( dv2 − du2 ) − r2( dθ2 + sin2θdϕ2 )		
						Under	these	conditions,	if	we	consider	the	radial	geodesics	of	zero	length,	followed	
by	the	light,	we	obtain	a	constant	value	of:

					We	therefore	have	two	formulas	for	changing	the	coordinate	r,	referring,	one	to	the

						In	science,	the	principle	of	Occam's	razor	applies,	which	encourages	us	to	opt	for	the	
explanation	that	requires	the	least	cumbersome	and	most	coherent	hypotheses.	
Kruskal's	hypotheses	do	not	go	in	this	direction.	We	note	in	particular	that	the	metric,	
expressed	with	the	help	of	these	coordinates,	does	not	tend	towards	the	Lorentz	metric	
at	infinity,	far	from	it,	since	in	this	case	the	function	f	tends	towards	zero.	
3	–	Geometries	of	real	worlds	and	geometries	of	complex	worlds.		
								Cosmology	is	based	on	a	modern	geometry,	which	evokes	the	concept	of	Riemanian	
hypersurfaces,	with	4	dimensions	and	a	hyperbolic	metric.	From	this	metric	it	is	then	
possible	to	construct	a	set	of	geodesic	curves,	the	examination	of	which	is	supposed	to	
allow	to	apprehend	their	geometrical	structure.	All	the	quantities	that	we	manipulate	
are	then	supposed	to	belong	to	the	world	of	the	real,	whether	they	are	coordinates	or	
the	measurement	of	the	element	of	length	s.		
				What	we	lose	sight	of	is	the	fact	that	we	can	consider	curves,	as	sequences	of	points,	
which	are	not	geodesics,	but	belong	to	the	object.	The	metric	tool,	however,	keeps	its	
functionality.	Let	us	give	an	example	in	two	dimensions,	through	the	metric,	of	signature

						Note	that	this	represents	a	fragment	of	the	Schwarzschild	metric.	It	is	associated	with

plunge	in	and	constructed	the	equation	of	its	meridian	[9].

Fig.12	:	The	Flamm’s	surface.	

						This	object	is	generated	by	the	rotation	of	a	parabola	lying	around	an	axis.	Its	
parabolic	meridians	are	also	geodesics.	Nevertheless	one	can	analyze	its	topology	by	
evaluating	the	perimeter	of	closed	curves,	at	constant	r,	which	are	circles,	but	are	not	
geodesics	of	the	surface.	This	perimeter	 2π r,	ceases	to	be	real	for	r	<	Rs.	We	therefore	
consider	that	this	one	is	minimal	and	that	there	are	closed	curves	which,	transformed	by	
regular	 homotopy,	have	this	property.	The	object	is	therefore	not	 contractible.	It	is	a	
geometrical	structure	which	establishes	a	bridge	between	two	2D	Euclidean	spaces.		
				By	passing	in	3D	we	can	consider	the	hypersurface	defined	by	its	metric	
(31)																																											
				Note	that	this	metric	is	nothig	but	the	spatial	part	of	the	Schwarzschild	metric.	While	
the	3D	object	was	invariant	by	the	action	of	O(2),	this	one	is	invariant	by	the	action	of	
O(3).	We	can	show	again	its	non-contractibility	by	computing	by	integration	the	area	of	
the	object	constituted	by	the	subset	of	points	corresponding	to	a	constant	value	of	the	
coordinate.

				Again,	in	the	realm	of	the	real	we	conclude	that	this	area	has	a	minimal	value	which	is	
that	of	its	throat	sphere.		The	considered	object	can	be	interpreted	as	resulting	from	the

But	these	are	not	geodesics	of	the	object	corresponding	to	the	metric	(17).	These	two	
surfaces	are	also	generated	by	the	action	of	groups,	O(2)	in	the	case	of	the	Flamm	
surface	and	O(3)	in	this	3D	hypersurface,	ensuring	a	bridge	between	two	Euclidean	3D	
spaces,	through	the	intermediary	of	a	throat	sphere	of	area	 4π Rs
2.		
				This	3D	hypersurface	thus	presents	two	modes	of	generation.	Either	this	one	is	done	
by	a	folding	using	spheres	deduced	from	the	throat	sphere	by	homothety.	The	topology	
is	then	that	of	a	bounded	manifold	and	the	geodesics	of	the	spheres	are	not	geodesics	of	
the	hypersurface.	In	a	coordinate	system	the	sections	by	"planes	r	=	Cst	are	circles.		Let	
this	one	be	generated	by	the	action	of	O(3)	on	a	Flamm	surface.	The	object	then	inherits	
the	non-contractibility.	To	convince	oneself	of	this,	one	must	imagine	that	the	Flamm	
surface,	tilting	according	to	the	two	angles	 θ and ϕ,	sees	all	its	points	maintained	at	a	
distance	from	the	geometric	center	greater	than	Rs.	The	infinite	positions	of	this	surface,	
according	to	the	rotations,	make	that	it	always	remains	tangent	to	the	throat	circle,	
according	to	one	of	its	great	circles.	The	resulting	3D	hypersurface	thus	corresponds	to	a	
bridge	connecting	two	Euclidean	3D	spaces,	which	is	also	the	two-folds	covering	of	a	3D	
2.	This	time	
bounded	manifold,	this	one	being	bounded	by	the	sphere	of	area	 4π Rs
curves	resulting	from	the	action	of	O(3)	on	the	geodesics	of	the	Flamm	surface	are	also	
the	geodesics	of	the	3D	hypersurface	
						The	Schwarzschild	hypersurface	is	invariant	by	the	action	of	two	groups	:	O(3)	and	
by	R	(translations),	which	conjugate	through	 O(3) × R.	This	hypersurface	is	deduced	
from	the	previous	one	by	time	translation.	It	inherits	its	property	of	non-contractibility.	
As	suggested	by	Ludwig	Flamm	this	3D	hypersurface	can	be	considered	as	the	
intersection	of	hypersurface	4	by	"planes	t	=	Cst".	But	the	geodesics	of	the	3D	
hypersurface	are	then	not	geodesics	of	the	Schwarzschild	4D	hypersurface.	Moreover	
the	hyperbolic	character	of	the	metric	makes	that	the	calculation	of	a	perimeter	
corresponding	to	constant	t	,	θand	r	gives	an	imaginary	value	:	
dϕ																																																			
	(33)																																												
					This	leads	to	the	eminently	disconcerting	character	of	the	geometry	of	hypersurfaces	
defined	by	hyperbolic	metrics.	Everything	depends	then	on	the	space	in	which	we	
decide	to	represent	the	hypersurfaces,	corresponding	to	what	we	consider	as	physical	
reality.	In	a	space	where	everything	is	complex,	the	coordinates	as	well	as	the	length	
element,	everything	can	happen,	everything	is	acceptable.	A	part	of	the	hypersurface	can	
correspond	to	real	values	of	the	coordinates	(for	r	>	Rs),	leading	to	a	real	value	of	the	
length	element.		But,	not	less	real	values	of	these	coordinates	can	lead	to	a	pure	
imaginary	value	of	this	same	length	element	:	case	of	the	Schwarzschild	metric	when
 r < R s.		
				Instead	of	considering	a	topological	interpretation,	the	post-war	cosmologists,	
obsessed	by	the	idea	of	a	supposed	contractibility	of	space,	did	not	realize	that	they	
were	operating	an	extension	of	the	solution	into	the	world	of	complexes.	By	the	
confusing	game	of	algebraic	calculation,	the	integration	of	the	length	according	to	a	
geodesic	extended	to	r	=	0	gives	...	a	real	value!		Here	is	a	curve	whose	points	are	marked

with	real	values	of	the	coordinates,	where	the	integrated	length	is	real,	which	is	located

systematically	renewed	in	the	following	decades,	see	his	equation	(14)	reproduced	in	
figure	(2).	This	assumption	is	essential	in	the	black	hole	model,	because	it	gives	infinite	
free-fall	and	escape	times	of	a	witness-mass,	which	allowed	its	designers	to	present	the	
Schwarzschild	solution,	a	stationary	solution	of	the	Einstein	equation,	expressed	in	the

}	as	a	"snapshot"	of	an	unsteady	process,	thus	
allowing	to	assimilate	the	resulting	physical	model	to	a	"freeze-frame"	extracted	from	an	
extremely	fast	implosion	process.	We	have	assigned	the	time	variable	an	index	s	because,	
strictly	speaking,	it	is	the	"Schwarzschild	time	ts	".

				Kerr's	metric	(14),	hailed	by	Chandrasekhar	in	his	book	[20]	as	a	true	triumph	of	
mathematical	research	oriented	towards	the	beauty	of	the	mathematical	solution,	has	a	
cross	term	in	dr	dϕ.	We	have	seen	that	this	had	received	an	attempt	at	interpretation	
according	to	which	the	coordinate	system,	i.e.	"space",	was	somehow	"dragged	along"	by	
matter,	which	gave	back	corpps	to	the	idea	of	Ernst	Mach.	Why	then	not	consider	a	
"radial	frame	dragging",	a	radial	dragging	of	the	coordinate	system.	
							It	is	therefore	perfectly	licit	to	explore	the	properties	of	a	representation	accepting	
the	presence	of	a	term	in	dr	dt.	There	have	been	several	attempts	in	this	direction,

					To	try	to	represent	the	phenomena,	we	have	only	images	resulting	from	the	choice	of	
coordinates,	each	of	these	representations	having	their	interest,	with	respect	to	the	
geometrical	intuition,	and	their	defects.	If	we	opt	for	a	representation	 ( r , ϕ )according	
to	the	coordinates	of	plane	geodesics,	we	have	in	mind	the	image	of	a	sphere	of	throat	of	
finite	area	but	where	the	interior	of	this	sphere	does	not	belong	to	the	hypersurface.											
When	a	mass	plunges	towards	this	gorge	sphere,	it	seems	to	"bounce"	on	it.	We	have	an	
image	of	the	portion	of	trajectory	corresponding	to	this	"bounce"	but	the	geodesics	of	
this	second	sheet	constitute,	with	respect	to	the	starting	sheet,	a	disjointed	whole.	As	the	
perception	that	we	can	have	only	proceeds	through	the	medium	of	electromagnetic	
waves,	travelling	on	geodesics	of	zero	length,	we	have	to	give	up	the	idea	of	obtaining	an	
evidence	of	these	masses	through	observations,	once	they	have	passed	on	this	kind	of	
"reverse	of	the	universe".	In	fact,	the	most	telling	2D	didactic	image	is	that	of	a	hole,	with	
a	circular	edge,	made	in	a	sheet	of	paper.		The	universe,	where	we	can	walk,	is	the	paper.	
In	the	hole,	the	paper	is	absent.	A	hole	is	the	topological	solution	allowing	to	pass	from	
the	front	to	the	back	of	a	surface.	This	geometry,	which	we	see	being	built,	suggests	that	
the	notions	of	front	and	back	apply	to	hypersurfaces	with	more	than	two	dimensions.	In	
3D	we	can	consider	the	non-contractible	hypersurface,	defined	by	the	metric	(27).		The	
two	3D	Euclidean	sheets,	thus	put	in	communication,	must	be	considered	as	the	"front"	
and	"back"	of	the	3D	hypersurface	constituted	by	the	Euclidean	space	we	are	familiar	
with.	Becoming	aware	of	this	must	become	as	obvious	as	discovering	that	one	can	write	
on	the	front	and	back	of	a	sheet	of	paper.	Keeping	in	mind	that	"the	inhabitants	of	the	
front	side"	cannot	"see"	the	inhabitants	of	the	back	side,	and	vice	versa.	
						If	we	opt	for	a	representation	
}the	sphere	of	throat	disappears,	is	
reduced	to	a	point.	Continuity	appears.	But	we	must	then	consider	that	two	points	
diametrically	opposed	with	respect	to	the	center	of	symmetry	correspond	in	fact	to	the	
same	region	of	space-time,	to	two	points	located	"on	either	side"	of	the	4D	hypersurface.	
Moreover,	if	we	construct	a	sphere	containing	this	point	O	and	if	we	deform	it	by	regular

							The	action	of	the	group	on	its	momentum	space		is	written	[30]:		
(60)																																																										 
	
									The	Lorentz	group	has	four	related	components,	two	orthochron	(not	reversing	the	
time	coordinate)	and	two	"antichron"	(reversing	the	time	coordinate).		
							In	physics,	conceived	through	the	prism	of	relativity,	particles	follow	geodesics	of	
space-time.	On	short	distances	and	short	intervals	of	time	these	geodesics	are	close	to	
geodesics	of	tangent	space,	the	Minkowski	space.	The	elements	of	the	group	allow	to	
decline	the	fans	of	the	motions	of	the	different	particles.	According	to	geodesics	of	zero	
length:	these	are	photons.	According	to	geodesics	of	non-zero	length	it	is	particles	with	a	
non-zero	mass.		
					The	antichronic	components	of	the	Lorentz	group,	and	therefore	of	the	Poincaré	
group,	which	inherits	this	property,	reverse	time	and,	correlatively,	energy	E	and	mass	
m.	Mathematical	formalisms	sometimes	suggest	the	existence	of	exotic	objects.	
Sometimes	this	does	not	work.	But	sometimes	it	does	work.	The	typical	example	is	
Dirac's	prediction	of	the	existence	of	antimatter,	which	aroused	great	skepticism,	until	
the	analysis	of	the	motion	of	electrons	from	cosmic	rays	confirmed	the	Englishman's	
prediction.		
					The	complete	Poincaré	group	(whose	subgroup,	the	restricted	Poincaré	group,	is	
limited	to	its	orthochron	components)	predicts	the	existence	of	particles	of	negative	
energy	and	mass.	Does	this	correspond	to	a	physical	reality?		
				The	answer	lies	in	the	evidence	of	the	acceleration	of	the	cosmic	expansion,	under	the	
effect	of	a	negative	pressure.	Now	a	pressure,	if	we	usually	perceive	it	as	a	force	per	unit	
area,	is	also	a	volumetric	density	of	energy.	Hence	the	birth	of	the	concept	of	dark	
energy.		
					To	a	gas	made	of	particles	of	negative	mass	is	automatically	associated	the	negative	
pressure	:

						If	the	mass	is	a	little	higher	than	this	critical	value,	f	changes	sign.	But	the	proper	time	
τ	cannot	be	reversed,	so	it	is	the	time	coordinate	which	is	reversed,	and	beyond	that	the	
energy	and	the	mass	of	the	particles	contained	in	this	portion	of	space.	
					We	can	see	that	this	theme	of	an	inversion	of	the	time,	energy	and	mass	coordinates	
manifests	itself	once	again.			
			We	note	that	the	formalisms	of	quantum	mechanics	also	generate	states	of	negative	
energy	[40],	[41].					
			It	is	always	difficult	to	rely	on	a	stationary	solution	to	describe	an	unsteady	process.	
We	will	consider	the	case	of	a	subcritical	neutron	star,	or	more	generally	of	a	subcritical	
mass,	such	as	supermassive	objects	located	at	the	center	of	galaxies.	In	this	situation	the	
pressure	at	the	center	is,	if	not	infinite,	at	least	very	high.	
				Let	us	imagine	that	these	objects	receive	a	material	contribution	whose	value	can	be	
considered	as	low	compared	to	their	mass.	We	can	then	refer	to	the	behavior	of	the	
“time	factor”	f,	under	these	conditions.	Such	a	situation	is	evoked	in	figure	25	with	two

curves	which	include	a	part	(reinforced	black	line)	for	this	factor	is	then	negative.	If	 τ  is	
the	proper	time,	t	the	time	variable	and	f	the	time	factor,	we	then,	along	a	geodesic:	
		(68)																																																																 dτ = f dt		
						As	we	have	already	said	above,	but	it	seems	important	to	us	to	insist	on	this	point,	the	
progression	of	proper	time	 τ,	along	a	geodesic,	is	synonymous	with	progress	in	a	past-
future	direction.	The	increment	cannot	therefore	be	reversed.	So,	if	f	inverts,	it	means	
that	the	time	variable	t	must	also	invert	and	we	know,	from	the	theory	of	dynamic	
groups	[30],	that	this	inversion	of	the	time	coordinate	t	is	synonymous	with	l	inversion	
of	energy,	and	mass.	Same	observation	in	quantum	mechanics	([40],[41]).	
					There	is	another	way	to	reach	the	same	conclusion,	by	considering	the	evolution	of	the	
pressure	inside	the	mass	([8],[13],[14],[19]).	This	law	of	relativistic	pressure	evolution	
in	a	fluid	sphere	of	constant	density	  ρo  was	initially	given	in	1916	by	Karl	
Schwarzschild	[5]:	
		(69)																																							
				We	easily	fall	back	on	a	representation	function	of	r	by	applying	the	change	of	
coordinate:	
	(70)																																												
						We	then	obtain	the	relationship	giving	the	pressure	as	a	function	of	the	distance	from	
the	center	r.	
	(71)																																							
					Ra	being	the	radius	of	the	star.	Physical	criticality	manifests	itself	as	soon	as	this	ray	
reaches	the	value:	
	(72)																																																											
ˆR = 0.9424  ˆR																																																															
							The	pressure	at	the	center	of	the	star	then	becomes	infinite.	If	we	then	exceed	the	
criticality	a	little	bit,	that	is	to	say	that	we	place	ourselves	in	
R a > R cr phys,	not	only	does	a	
surface	appear	centered	on	the	origin,	where	the	pressure	becomes	infinite,	but	inside	
this	surface	this	pressure	becomes	negative.	As	its	sign	depends	on	the	value	of	the	mass	
density,	we	deduce	that	inside	this	sphere	the	mass	is	inverted.		
						Consider,	as	an	example,	a	mass	contribution,	emanating	from	a	companion	star,	
changing	its	radius	to	 ra = 0.9424  ˆR	,	which	corresponds	to	a	mass	contribution	of	three

thousandths.	The	star	reacts	by	unltra-fast	deployment	of	a	"mass	inversion	front",	at

Fig.27	:	Pressure	reversal	when	physical	criticality	is	exceeded	

 				The	inversion	of	pressure	is	synonymous	with	the	inversion	of	mass.	Thus	this	matter,	
whose	mass,	equivalent,	is	then	inverted,	then	undergoes	the	ambient	gravitational	field.	
Although	self-attracting,	it	finds	itself	ejected	from	the	star.	This	is	the	description	of	the	
self-stability	of	these	subcritical	objects.	
							When	this	pressure	increases,	the	speed	of	thermal	agitation	reaches	the	speed	of	
light.	Then,	with	the	assumption	of	a	constant	mass	density,	it	would	then	be	the	speed	
of	light	which	would	become	infinite,	as	Schwarzschild	notes.	Thus	this	variability	of	the	
speed	of	light	was	for	the	first	time	mentioned	in	an	article	more	than	a	century	ago.	See	
equation	(69).	
				The	figure	below	gives	the	extremely	brutal	development	of	the	"mass	inversion	front",	
where	the	speed	of	the	light	is	infinite,	as	a	function	of	the	radius	of	the	star.	Its	shape	
evokes	the	rapid	response	of	the	system.	
	

	

8- Some	comments	about	“before	the	Big	Bang”	

Fig.28:	Development	of	the	“mass	inversion	front”	

		
							This	leads	us	to	reflect	on	the	way	we	conceive	of	the	Big	Bang	and	on	the	question	
that	everyone	asks	“what	was	there	before?	".						
							In	the	modeling	that	is	carried	out	of	neutron	stars,	there	are	successive	layers.	First	
comes	a	superficial	layer	of	iron,	in	the	state	of	plasma.	Just	below,	a	second	plasma	
made	up	of	protons,	neutrons	and	electrons.

Fig.29	:	Structure	of	a	subcritical	neutron	star	(schematic)

			Then	these	electrons	combine	with	the	protons,	simply	because	there	is	no	more	space	
available	for	them	to	accommodate	their	wave	function,	the	characteristic	value	of	
which	is	their	Compton	length.	
	Lower	down,	there	remains	a	mixture	of	neutrons,	protons	and	mesons,	whose	Compton	
length,	two	orders	of	magnitude	less,	allows	them	to	remain.	
 						Finally,	only	the	neutrons	remain.	Beyond	the	theorists	imagine	that	we	find	a	
mixture	of	quarks	in	the	free	state.	But	things	can	be	different.	Beyond	that,	the	distance	
separating	the	neutrons	becoming	less	than	their	Compton	distance,	their	mass	would	
be	reversed	and	they	would	leave	the	star	freely.	
							If	we	transpose	this	scenario	to	the	past	of	the	universe,	there	might	be	nothing	
beyond	neutrons,	in	the	race	towards	high	densities.	Beyond	that,	the	arrow	of	time	
would	be	reversed.	We	obtain	the	Janus	diagram	of	this	“genesis”	of	the	universe.	
	

		

	
	

Fig.30	:	2D	didactic	image	of	Janus	geometry.	

						Geometrically,	if	we	assimilate	the	arrow	of	time	to	the	normal	vector	of	a	unilateral	
surface,	we	can	think	of	the	development	of	a	layer	of	paint	affixed	to	a	Möbius	strip,	this	
one	evoking	the	situation	of	the	universe	in	its	“initial”	stage.	»	:	chronologically	
inorientable.

Fig.31	:	Genesis	of	the	two	antiparallel	arrows	of	time	

							A	way	of	presenting	things	that	may	interest	philosophers.	It	is	therefore	not	an	
arrow	of	time	that	would	see	the	light	of	day	at	this	"zero"	instant,	but	two	arrows	of	
time	in	opposition,	which	would	go	hand	in	hand	with	the	inversion	of	mass	and	energy.	
This	operation	then	puts	in	interaction	two	4D	“folds”	of	the	universe,	not	only	T-
symmetric	but	CPT-symmetric.	The	idea	that	the	universe	has	another	“side”,	CPT-
symmetric	is	also	present	in	other	researchers	[43].	But	no	one	envisages	for	the	
moment	this	form	of	folding	of	the	universe	on	itself	as	a	covering	with	two	sheets	of	a	
four-dimensional	hypersurface,	having	the	topology	of	a	covering	with	two	sheets	of	a	
projective	P4,	or	rather	a	4D	extension	of	a	four-dimensional	Klein	bottle	type	geometry.	
	9-	A	cosmology	with	inclusion	of	negative	masses.	
				The	question	then	arises	of	how	to	introduce	negative	masses	into	the	cosmological	
model.		If	we	stick	to	the	Einsteinian	geometrical	context,	based	on	a	single	field	
equation,	it	is	impossible.	Indeed,	locally,	there	is	only	one	family	of	geodesics.	Therefore,	
test	particles,	whether	their	mass	is	positive	or	negative,	react	in	the	same	way	when	
they	are	immersed	in	the	gravitational	field.	In	this	context,	if	the	appearance	of	a	
physical	criticality	would	lead	to	a	reversal	of	the	mass	of	the	particles	located	in	the	
immediate	vicinity	of	the	geometric	center	of	the	star	would	remain	confined	within	it.	
Moreover,	as	a	general	rule,	the	introduction	of	negative	masses	in	the	Einsteinian	
universe	generates	the	unmanageable	 runaway	phenomenon,	which	contradicts	two	
principles:	
-  The	action-reaction	principle	
	
-  The	principle	of	equivalence.

in	the	field	created	by	the	positive	mass	M	

Fig.33	:	Geodesic	followed	by	a	negative	mass,		

						We	note	the	necessary	high	value	to	give	to	the	parameter	 λ.	The	explanation	is	
simple.	By	"pulling"	a	negative	mass	towards	the	object,	so	as	to	allow	it	to	approach	it	at	
a	distance	of	only	a	few	Schwarzschild	radii,	i.e.	in	regions	where	a	gravitational	field,	in	
this	case	repulsive,	is	very	intense,	it	is	necessary	to	communicate	to	it,	at	a	very	great	
distance,	a	velocity	such	that	the	kinetic	energy	which	accompanies	it,	negative,	is	no	
longer	negligible	in	front	of	its	also	negative	energy	mc2.		
				To	give	an	idea	of	this	acceleration	and	of	the	way	in	which	the	projection	of	the	
geodesic	is	modified,	we	indicate	hereafter	what	emerges	from	a	combination	of	the	two	
geodesic	arcs	deriving	from	the	external	Schwarzschid	metric,	attractive,	then	repulsive	
in	the	second	sheet	in	their	polar	representation	 ( ρ , ϕ ),	a	curve	to	be	compared	to	that	
of	figure	21

							Curve	to	be	compared	with	that	of	figure	23.	This	double	continuity	leads	to	the	
global	continuity	of	the	geodesic	after	crossing	a	sphere	of	throat.	
				As	a	conclusion	the	negative	masses	ejected	will	be	given,	under	the	effect	of	the	
repulsion,	a	non-negligible	speed	in	front	of	c.	The	idea	of	a	non	conservation	of	the	
kinetic	energy	(in	absolute	value)	induces	a	distorted	vision	of	the	phenomena.	It	is	
necessary	to	take	into	account	the	gravitational	energy	in	the	balance,	implied	by	the	
dispersion	of	negative	masses.		
	11	–	Falsifiability	of	the	Plugstar	model.		
					No	theoretical	model	can	be	considered	if	it	does	not	fit	with	observational	data.	The	
Janus	model,	among	the	main	effects	explained:		
	-	Accounts	for	the	confinement	of	galaxies,	undergoing	the	back	pressure	of	the	
surrounding	negative	mass,	which	explains	in	passing	the	flatness	of	their	rotation	
curves,	as	well	as	the	strong	gravitational	lensing	effects	produced.	A	similar	
observation	is	made	for	galaxy	clusters,	explaining	the	high	velocities	of	their	
components.	Thus	the	Janus	model	([31]	to	[41]),	advantageously	replaces	the	use	of	
hypothetical	positive	mass	dark	matter	by	a	negative	mass	content.		
	-	Accounts	for	the	acceleration	of	the	cosmic	expansion	([31],	[33]),	the	dark	energy	
being	only	the	energy	of	negative	mass	particles.	
	-	Accounts	for	the	lacunar	structure	of	negative	mass,	organized	around	invisible	
conglomerates	of	negative	mass,	the	dipole	repeller	object	being	one	of	them	[37].		
	

	

47	
-	Provides	a	model	of	a	perennial	galactic	spiral	structure	[31],	a	phenomenon	
reflecting	a	transfer	of	momentum	(dynamical	friction)	by	density	waves	towards	the	
negative	mass	environment	[32].	
	-	Gives	to	the	invisible	components	of	the	universe	a	precise	identity:	antiprotons,	
antineutrons,	antielectrons	of	negative	mass,	this	set	constituting	the	primordial	
antimatter,	escaping	observation	because	emitting	photons	of	negative	energy	[31].		
-	Makes	interstellar	travel	non-impossible,	as	distances	become	a	hundred	times	shorter	
in	the	second	fold	of	the	universe	and	the	speed	of	light,	of	negative	energy	photons,	ten	
times	higher	[38].	
					Although	it	will	be	a	long	time	before	we	have	sufficiently	precise	data	on	the	X-ray	
sources,	companions	of	stars,	we	have	such	data	for	two	hypermassive	objects	located,	
one	at	the	center	of	the	galaxy	M87,	the	other	at	the	center	of	the	Milky	Way.	The	
measurements	of	the	ratios	of	the	brightness	temperatures,	maximum	and	minimum,	for	
these	two	objects,	is	found	to	be	very	close	to	3.			
					Let	us	calculate	the	value	of	this	gravitational	redshift	z	which	is	then	common	to	all	
plugstars,	whatever	their	mass	M.		
					Let	Ra	be	the	radius	of	the	star,	which	is	then	
	while	the	
Schwarzschid	radius	is	
.		
				The	gravitational	redshift,	affecting	the	light	emitted	at	the	surface	of	the	star	in	a	
radial	direction	pointing	to	the	observer,	is	then:	
				This	is	exactly	the	value	that	can	be	deduced	from	the	first	two	images	of	
supermassive	objects	located	at	the	center	of	the	M87	galaxies	and	the	Milky	Way.		
				Other	images	of	supermassive	objects	will	appear.	We	conjecture	that	these	
brightness	temperature	ratios	will	be	systematically	equal	or	lower	than	3.	An	ancillary	
consequence	is	the	questioning	of	the	evaluation	of	the	masses	of	merging	objects.	The	
scenario	of	these	mergers,	as	well	as	that	of	the	creation	of	neutron	stars	in	stars	with	
the	highest	masses	(up	to	200	solar	masses)	remain	to	be	written.	In	the	supernova	
phenomenon,	when	the	mass	of	the	massive	star	collapses	on	its	iron	core.	If	the	mass	
involved	exceeds	2	solar	masses	the	physical	criticality	is	immediate	and	the	excess	
mass	is	reversed.	This	inversion	results	in	the	emission	of	a	gravitational	wave	of	
phenomenal	intensity.	The	same	scenario	applies	to	the	fusion	of	two	subcritical	
neutron	stars,	if	the	sum	of	their	masses	exceeds	2	solar	masses.	
					The	non-inclusion	of	this	alternative	scenario	casts	doubt	on	the	evaluation	of	the	
masses	of	"stellar	black	holes",	resulting	from	the	calculations	of	Kip	Thorne

	12	–	Conclusion		
				We	show	that	the	construction	of	the	black	hole	model	was	based	on	a	failure	to	take	
into	account	the	second	paper	of	Karl	Schwarzschild,	describing	the	geometry	inside	the	
masses,	which	already	at	that	time	mentioned	a	physical	criticality	occurring	before	the	
mass	corresponding	to	the	classical	geometric	criticality	appeared.	The	explanation	lies	
in	the	fact	that	the	first	English	translation	of	this	second	article	appeared	only	in	1999.	
Many	specialists	are	not	even	aware	of	its	existence.	The	model,	exclusively	based	on	the	
"external"	solution	of	Schwarzschild	(and	later	of	Kerr)	has	many	weaknesses	and	
incongruities	on	the	mathematical	and	geometrical	level,	which	are	highlighted.	With	
such	errors	at	the	beginning	one	cannot	build	a	scenario	leading	to	this	vision	of	a	
geometry	organized	around	a	hypothetical	"central	singularity".	Indeed,	when	one	starts	
from	a	sound	geometry,	based	on	the	two	metrics	constructed	by	Schwarzschild	in	1916,	
describing	the	interior	and	the	interior	of	a	star,	a	physical	criticality	appears	even	
before	this	geometrical	criticality	appears.	It	is	shown	that	this	results	in	the	appearance	
of	a	region,	in	the	vicinity	of	the	center,	where	the	inversion	of	the	time	coordinate	leads	
to	that	of	the	energy	and	mass	of	the	particles	involved.	This	observation	calls	for	the	
introduction	of	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	model.	This,	because	of	the	
appearance	of	the	runaway	phenomenon	and	the	violation	of	the	action-reaction	and	
equivalence	principles,	is	impossible	in	the	framework	of	general	relativity,	based	on	the	
unique	Einstein	field	equation.	By	opting	for	the	Janus	model,	based	on	numerous	
interaction,	 derived	 from	 Newtonian	
observational	 confirmations,	 the	
approximations,	change.	Masses	of	the	same	sign	attract	each	other	while	masses	of	
opposite	signs	repel	each	other.	Sensitive	to	the	gravitational	field	created	by	the	
negative	mass,	the	negative	masses	are	powerfully	ejected	by	freely	crossing	the	star.	
This	leads	to	a	feedback	phenomenon	which	limits	the	masses	to	their	subcritical	value.	
For	neutron	stars:	around	2	solar	masses.	The	existence	of	stellar	black	holes	is	
therefore	questioned.	Supermassive	objects,	whose	formation	will	be	explained	in	a	
future	article,	are	also	subcritical	objects,	Plugstars.	The	theory	gives	all	plugstars	a	
gravitational	redshift	of	3.	This	is	exactly	what	is	shown	by	the	measurements	of	the	
images	of	two	hypermassive	objects	located	at	the	center	of	the	galaxies	M87	and	the	
Milky	Way.		
					We	predict	that	this	redshift	of	3	will	accompany	future	images	of	hypermassive	
objects	that	will	appear	in	the	future.
