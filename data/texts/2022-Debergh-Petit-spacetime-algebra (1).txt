Abstract

We consider four subsets of the complexiﬁed spacetime algebra,
namely the real even part, the real odd part, the imaginary even part
and the imaginary odd part. This naturally leads to the four con-
nected components of the Lorentz group, supplemented each time by
an additional symmetry. We then examine how these four parts im-
pact the Dirac equation and show that four types of matter arise with
positive and negative masses as well as positive and negative charges.

Keywords: geometric algebra, spacetime algebra, Dirac equation, negative mass

Introduction

Geometric algebra was discovered jointly by Cliﬀord and Grassmann in the
late 19th century [1, 2]. Despite its innovative and promising aspects, this
algebra did not get the attention it deserved at that time.
In fact, most
researchers have only exploited the purely algebraic aspects of this concept
and have obscured the other facets.

It was not until the work of Hestenes [3] that the richness of geometric
algebra was fully realized. Since then, some scientists have made signiﬁcant
contributions and ﬁrmly believe (an opinion we share) that geometric algebra
is the simplest and most coherent language that can reconcile physics with
mathematics. The subject itself is covered in detail in [3–5].

Geometric algebra can be considered in any physical discipline but where
it probably takes a particular importance is the physics of the electron [6].
Generalizing the concept of complex numbers, it allows to highlight an inter-
esting alternative to the Dirac theory. This other option is referred to as the
real formulation of the Dirac equation or the Dirac-Hestenes equation [7–9].

This proposition is based on the geometric algebra related to the Minkowski
spacetime (namely the spacetime algebra) and, surprisingly enough, only one
part of this algebra (the part referred to as the real even part) is necessary
to have equivalence with the Dirac formulation.

On a diﬀerent level, the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe has
been observed by astronomers [10]. This discovery implies the existence of
unknown matter and energy (i.e. the dark matter and the dark energy). If
their natures are still a mystery, there is more and more evidence to say that
particles of negative masses [11] could be the best candidates to solve this
enigma [12–18].

The negative mass matter interacting only by gravity with positive mass
matter (and not through electromagnetic phenomena), it is not possible to
directly experiment it. Its detection is done indirectly by analysing the alter-
ation of the light emitted by positive mass matter. We refer the interested
reader to [19] for further details.

It is natural to wonder about a possible relation between spacetime alge-

bra and negative masses and it is precisely the goal of this paper.

In Section 1, we will show, after a brief recall on the basics of the geometric
algebra, that if only a part of the content (and by this we mean the even
real part) of the spacetime algebra has been really exploited in most of the
contributions on the geometric algebra of the electron, it is also possible
to consider the other parts (odd real part, even imaginary part and odd
imaginary part). These supplementary parts are connected to the usual one
by applying to it the discrete unitary operators P ,T ,P T .

This will naturally leads us, in Section 2, to revise the relativistic invari-
ance where not only the restricted Lorentz group SO+(1, 3) will be reached
but also its three connected components. When the odd part is included, we
will show that the Lie superalgebra gl(2|2) arises naturally.
of the Dirac equation, both with positive and negative masses.

Section 3 will be devoted to the highlighting of the four types of solutions

In Section 4, we will put in evidence the corresponding equations and

solutions within the geometric algebra formalism.

The relativistic invariance of these equations as well as the transformation
laws on their solutions will be discussed in Section 5. The remarkable point
is the appearance of an additional symmetry compared to the traditional
theory, symmetry which brings a transformation law on the mass.

We will conclude in the last Section.

2 Preliminary: the spacetime algebra and its

four components

First, we brieﬂy recall the fundamentals of a geometric algebra.
Let u and v be two vectors of a vector space of dimension n

(here and in the following, summation on repeated indices is understood).
The geometric product of these vectors is deﬁned according to

u = ujej,

v = vjej,

u v = u.v + u ∧ v.

In the ﬁrst term, we recognize the -symmetric- inner product (equivalent to
the scalar product when dealing exclusively with vectors). It gives rise to
a scalar (0-vector). In the second term, we ﬁnd the -antisymmetric- outer
product leading to a bivector (2-vector or oriented portion of plan).
In other words

u.v =

(u v + v u),

1
2

u ∧ v =

(u v − v u).

1
2

Applied to the (orthogonal) vector basis, the geometric product is such that

ej ek = −ek ej,

j 6= k.

It also generates a 2n-dimensional algebra made of one 0-vector, n 1-vectors,
n(n−1)

2-vectors and so on until one n-vector, respectively given by

2

1,

In ≡ e1 e2 ... en.
This n-vector In is also known as the pseudo-scalar unit.
Second, we particularize to spacetime algebra (STA) for which n = 4 and

ej ek,

ej,

...,

(5)

0 = −e2
e2

1 = −e2

2 = −e2

3 = 1.

From Eqs. (4) and (6), it is obvious to see that the basis vectors of the STA
are nothing but the generators of the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(1, 3) and can be
realized through the Dirac matrices (in the Weyl realization, for instance):

e0 = γ0 =(cid:18) 0 I

I 0 (cid:19) ,

ej = γj =(cid:18) 0

−σj

σj

0 (cid:19) ,

3

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(6)

(7)

where I is the identity matrix of dimension 2 and σj are the Pauli matrices.
A remarkable fact about STA is that its real even part

E = a0 I + aj γjγ0 −

1
2

j bj γkγl + b0 I4,
ǫkl

a0, aj, b0, bj ∈ R,

(8)

(where ǫkl
is the completely antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor) is a geometric
j
algebra in itself, namely the one associated with the 3D Euclidian space (SA).
This is easily seen by identifying the ﬁrst three 2-vectors of the STA with
the 1-vectors of the SA

It is then straightforward to see that

e′
j ≡ γjγ0.

1e′
je′
e′
k = −γjγk, I3 = e′

2e′

3 = γ0γ1γ2γ3 = I4.

Moreover, we can write

E = a0 I + aj e′

j + I4(b0 I + bj e′

j) = a0 I + ~a + I4(b0 I +~b) = a + I4 b. (11)

Here and in the following, we refer to the concept of relative vector [20]
(written with a lowercase letter)

by opposition to the one of proper vector (written with a capital letter)

u ≡ u0 I + uj e′

j = u0 I + ~u,

U ≡ u e0 = uµ eµ, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.

In addition to this real even part, we will consider three other contributions.
In total, we will have four types of elements of the (complexiﬁed) STA:

(9)

(10)

(12)

(13)

• the real even part

• the real odd part

E = a + I4 b,

(14a)

O ≡ γ0 E = a0 γ0 − aj γj −

1
2

j bj γ0γkγl + b0 γ1γ2γ3,
ǫkl

(14b)

• the imaginary even part

IE ≡ −i I4 E = i b0 I − i bj γ0γj +

j aj γjγk − i a0I4,
ǫkl

(14c)

i
2

4

• the imaginary odd part

IO ≡ −i γ1γ2γ3 E = i b0γ0 − i bj γj +

i
2

j aj γ0γkγl − i a0 γ1γ2γ3.
ǫkl
(14d)

Notice that the great majority of the authors focus on the real even part,
only. The reason is that this part is suﬃcient to recover the usual Dirac
equation (see Section 4). The only reference we found dealing with other
contributions is [21] but in a diﬀerent context than the one involved here
(the accent was there put on idempotent matrices).
If we follow the realization (7), these four contributions respectively read

(cid:18) N 0

0

bN (cid:19) , (cid:18) 0

N 0 (cid:19) , (cid:18) N 0
bN

0 −bN (cid:19) , (cid:18) 0 −bN
N 0 (cid:19) .

Here the matrix N is given by

N = (a0 + ib0)I + (aj + ibj)σj,

(15)

(16)

(17)

This involutive automorphism corresponds to the fact that each of the 3D
basis vector has been reversed.
The incoming calculations will be really simpliﬁed by remembering that

while bN refers, in agreement with the usual notation, to
bN = (a0 − ib0)I − (aj − ibj)σj.
a∗ (cid:19) ,
c d (cid:19) → bN =(cid:18) d∗ −c∗

where * is the usual complex conjugate and a, b, c, d four complex numbers.
Let us also mention that the operators in Eqs. (14b)-(14d) are not chosen at
random. In fact, as is well known, γ0 is the parity operator P for the Dirac
equation while −i I4 actually is the chirality operator γ5. However we prefer
to see this operator as the product of P and the last one −i γ1γ2γ3 which
has been identiﬁed [22] as the unitary time-reversal operator T for the Dirac
equation.
Consequently, the four contributions read

N =(cid:18) a b

−b∗

(18)

E, O = P E,

IE = P T E,

IO = T E.

(19)

This highly suggests to associate them to the four connected components of
the Lorentz group. That’s precisely the aim of the next Section.

3 The relativistic invariance

Following the standard STA approach, we deﬁne the position vector by

(20)

(21)

X = xµ γµ =(cid:18) 0 x
bx 0 (cid:19) ,

X ′ = M XfM .

where x = x0I + xjσj,bx = x0I − xjσj.

Let us now consider the transformations that this position vector can un-
dergo. The general relation is

c∗

(22)

It has been chosen so because,

We will also need a third conjugation combining the ﬁrst two ones

sists in totally swapping the order of the vectors (γjγk → γkγj, γjγkγl →
γlγkγj and so on).
diag(αI, α∗I), a property rather similar to the unitarity of transformations.
Moreover, when matrices of dimension 2 are concerned, this conjugation is
identical to the hermitic conjugation

The notationfM refers to a particular conjugation (called reversal) which con-
in general, MfM =
b∗ d∗ (cid:19) .
c d (cid:19) → eN = N † =(cid:18) a∗
N =(cid:18) a b
a (cid:19) .
c d (cid:19) → ¯N ≡ g(bN ) =(cid:18) d −b
N =(cid:18) a b
X ′ = MEXgME =(cid:18) N 0
bN (cid:19)(cid:18) 0 x
bx 0 (cid:19)(cid:18) ¯N 0
eN (cid:19) → x′ = N xeN ,
bx 0 (cid:19)(cid:18) 0
X ′ = MOXgMO =(cid:18) 0
N 0 (cid:19)(cid:18) 0 x
eN 0 (cid:19) → x′ = bNbx ¯N ,
bN
X ′ = MIEXgMIE =(cid:18) N 0
bx 0 (cid:19)(cid:18) ¯N 0
0 −bN (cid:19)(cid:18) 0 x
0 −eN (cid:19) → x′ = −N xeN ,

The transformations can then be of four types as suggested by Eq. (19)

(24d)
Each of these transformations (24) can be rewritten in a more usual way as

Besides, in all cases, the three rotations are given by

(we write the same parameter θ for the simplicity of the notation but it is
evidently subtended that each transformation has its own parameter) while
the boosts are obtained from

If we allow the determinant of N to diﬀer from 1 (and it is without any
consequence on R whose determinant still is 1), we also have to add a sup-
plementary transformation characterized by

Nsupplementary = e

i

2 θ I .

In the case of the transformation (24a), it is the well-known homomorphism
between the special linear group SL(2, C) (related to the matrix N when we
restrict ourselves to the cases where det N = 1 -a restriction that we will
give up in the following-) and the restricted Lorentz group SO+(1, 3) (asso-
ciated with R). It has to be mentioned that the transformations recovered
here -namely three rotations and three boosts- are proper and orthochronous
(component L↑
+ of the Lorentz group). In other words, they preserve the ori-
entation of space (a fact that can be seen from det R = 1) and the direction
of time (the element at the intersection of the ﬁrst row and the ﬁrst column
of R is positive).
The explicit form of the transformation matrices coming from the geometric
algebra point of view is given by

Mrotations = e− 1

2 θ γj γk , Mboosts = e− 1

2 θ γ0γk , Msupplementary = e

As well known, the six ﬁrst operators generate the Lorentz algebra so(1, 3)

[Jαβ, Jλρ] = gβλ Jρα + gαρ Jλβ + gβρ Jαλ + gαλ Jβρ,

g = diag(1,−1,−1,−1),
(30)
while J (still with a vanishing trace) commutes with each of these operators.
To ﬁnd back the other three connected components, the three other cases
(24b)-(24d) are necessary.
The proper retrochronous transformations (i.e. L↓
+ for which the time is re-
versed, a fact that is marked through a change of sign in R00) are obtained
through Eq. (24c). Indeed the result (24c) just means that R has been re-
placed by −R. At the level of the rotations, the interpretation is that not
only the time but also one of the spatial coordinates has been reversed. The
rotations themselves, in each of the planes subtended by two spatial coor-
dinates, are no longer rotations of angle θ in the clockwise direction but
rotation of angle π − θ in the trigonometric direction. At the boosts, all the
coordinates have been reversed but the velocity is unchanged. This total
inversion will be also found at the additional symmetry: x′ = −x.
The explicit form of the corresponding transformation matrices are obtained
from Eq. (29a) on which P T = −i I4 is applied. Obviously, they cannot be
written as exponentials anymore. However the relations (30) are still valid if
we consider the seven operators (29b) on which P T is applied on the left.
The improper orthochronous component (i.e. L↑
− for which the orientation of
space has been changed or, in other words, the determinant of R is now equal
to −1) is obtained from the odd transformation (24b). In fact, with respect
to the original matrix R, assigned to the proper orthochronous transforma-
tions, only the ﬁrst row is unchanged. The other rows have changed sign. In
what concerns the rotations, the time is unchanged while a spatial coordinate
is reversed. Once again, in each of the plane determined by the two other
spatial coordinates, there is no longer a rotation of θ in the clockwise direc-
tion but a rotation of π − θ in the trigonometric sense. For the boosts, we
notice that the time remains unchanged while the spatial coordinates have
been inversed and so is the velocity.
The explicit form of the corresponding transformation matrices is obtained
from Eqs. (29) on which P = γ0 is applied.
Let us also mention that the supplementary transformation is nothing but
this P operation. The corresponding matrix R gets the well-known form
diag(1,−1,−1,−1).
The improper retrochronous transformations (L↓

−) correspond to Eq. (24d).

8

The situation is the reverse of the previous one: only the ﬁrst row of the
matrix R has changed sign. So the rotations are the ones of the proper or-
thochronous transformations and only time has been reversed. The boosts
are, as in the previous context, characterized by an inversion of the velocity
due, in this case, to the reversal of time (the spatial coordinates remain un-
changed with respect to the proper orthochronous boosts).
As expected, the explicit form of the corresponding transformations is ob-
tained from Eqs. (29) on which T = −i γ1γ2γ3 is applied.
It is thus not
surprising that the supplementary transformation reduces to this unitary
time-reversal transformation and the corresponding R is diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).
Let us end this Section by mentioning that gl(2, C) is usually recognized as
the Lie algebra associated with the even part of the STA. It is due to the
presence of the matrix N on which no constraint is required. In particular,
the determinant (= ad − bc) can take any complex value, say rei θ. We have
focused here on the case where r = 1. Nevertheless, there remains an addi-
tional parameter (with respect to the Lorentz group) in the presence of the
angle, which is associated with this operator J.
If we consider the odd part in addition (as it is the case when we deal with
the improper transformations), we speak about a Lie superalgebra, that is
precisely gl(2|2). This superalgebra is characterized by the relations [23]

[Epq, Ers] = δqr Eps − (−1)((p)+(q))((r)+(s))δpsErq,

(31)

with the following rules : if p + q and r + s are odd numbers, the Lie bracket
is an anticommutator while it reduces to a commutator in all other cases.
To be convinced of this link, we realize the Cartan subalgebra generators
with

H1 = E11 + E33 =

even operators and one odd operator) as

(34)

where the product involved here is the geometric one.
Let us now turn our attention to the Dirac equation.

4 The Dirac equation with positive and neg-

ative masses

A remark to begin with: when Dirac established his famous equation, in the
free case, he only imposed conditions on the squares of the matrices (see
Eq. (6) of [24]) leaving the ﬁeld open to two possibilities of signs before the
mass term. On page 615 of his paper, he speciﬁes that he marks one possible
choice to satisfy these conditions.
So, at the start, the possibility of having negative masses was already present.
Now, let us consider the Dirac equation when the electron is in interaction
with an electromagnetic ﬁeld

(cid:16)γµ(∂µ + i e Aµ) + i m(cid:17) |φi+ = 0.

With the realization (7) and |φi+ ≡(cid:18) ξ+

η+ (cid:19), this equation can be written as

where the usual gradient ∆ issued from STA has been used as well as its

(cid:26) (∆ + i e A) η+ + i m ξ+ = 0
(b∆ + i e bA) ξ+ + i m η+ = 0
b∆ ≡ ∂0 + σj ∂j.

∆ ≡ ∂0 − σj ∂j,

10

conjugate b∆

(35)

(36)

(37)

To be coherent, an analogue of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has also been deﬁned

A ≡ A0 − σj Aj,

bA ≡ A0 + σj Aj.

By taking the complex conjugate of the system (36) and then multiplying it,
on the right, by −iσ2, we obtain

Here we have made use of

We are now ready to highlight four types of matter by looking closely at the
systems (36) and (39). Indeed, the system (36) shows us that if the electron
of positive matter

is the usual solution, there is an additional solution corresponding to a change
of sign in the last term and thus to an electron of negative mass. It is given
by

In what concerns the system (39), it tells us that there is a solution associated
with a positron of positive mass

as well as a solution corresponding to a positron of negative mass

We notice easily that

|φip,+ = i γ2 |φi∗

e,+,

|φip,− = −i γ2 |φi∗

e,−.

(42)

The ﬁrst of these two relations is what is expected from the well-known
charge conjugation operator. A change of sign with no consequence (a ket
being deﬁned up to a phase factor) is introduced within the negative masses
counterpart.
We also see that

|φie,− = −i I4 |φie,+,

|φip,− = −i I4 |φie,−.

(43)

Now, the matrix −i I4 , belonging to the imaginary extension of the STA, is
nothing else than the chirality operator γ5.

5 The Dirac-Hestenes equation with positive

and negative masses

We owe it to Hestenes to have proposed the counterpart of the Dirac equation
in the context of geometric algebra. This (real) equation is

(44)

(45)

It can also be proposed on the form

γµ(cid:16)∂µφ γ2γ1 − e Aµ φ(cid:17) = m φ γ0.
( −i∆bΦ σ3 + e AbΦ + m Φ = 0
−ib∆ Φ σ3 + e bA Φ + mbΦ = 0

with φ =(cid:18) Φ 0
0 bΦ (cid:19).

It is then usually said that the whole Dirac formalism is contained in the
ﬁrst 2 by 2 equation of Eq. (45) as the second one is simply its conjugate in
the sense σj → −σj.
Hestenes’ demonstration of his equation is as follows: he proposed to consider
a bispineur |ui such that

hu|ui = 1,

γ0|ui = |ui,

γ2γ1|ui = i|ui.

(46)

12

(47)

(48)

(49)

It is then suﬃcient to put

|φi+ = φ |ui,

to recover Eq. (35).
If we are interested in the precise form of the ket |ui satisfying Eq. (46) with
the realization (7), we obtain

|ui =

At this stage, we have to make a few remarks.
First, the STA approach allows us to see unusual facts. By this we mean that
the ﬁrst block on the diagonal contains all the information of the traditional
theory. But what do we see there? The simultaneous consideration of the
electron of positive mass and of what seems to be, at ﬁrst sight, the positron of
positive mass (cf. the ﬁrst two components of Eq. (41a) and Eq. (41c)). But
if we look at it more closely and consider the second block on the diagonal,
we see that, if we conﬁrm the presence of the electron with positive mass,
the antiparticle is, on the other hand, characterized by a negative mass (cf.
Eq. (41d))!
Second, this combination of positive matter-negative antimatter is typical to
have considered the real even part of the STA only. Indeed, Eq. (49) is of
type E in Eq. (15)).
So the question arises naturally: is it possible to put in evidence the other
solutions Eq. (41c) (we restrict ourselves to even matrices)?
For this purpose, we modify Eq. (47) and consider, instead

|φi− = −i I4 |ui.

The new matrix −i I4 φ is then of IE-type and writes explicitly

So we now have the combination of negative matter-positive antimatter and
the Dirac-Hestenes equation is slightly modiﬁed to write

Compared to the original one (44), we notice a change of sign in what con-
cerns the mass term. The four types of matter (antimatter) can thus be
embedded in a system made up of Eqs. (44) and (52).
Let us now have a look on the transformations of the wave functions.

6 Relativistic invariance of the Dirac equa-

tion with positive and negative masses

We concentrate here on the free case since it is implied that the transfor-
mations of the derivatives and components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are
identical in form.
The question is the following: how can we characterize the transformation
|φ′i± on |φi± such that

transforms as

(γµ ∂µ ± i m) |φi± = 0,

(γµ ∂′

µ ± i m′) |φ′i± = 0,

(53b)

µ is speciﬁed according to one of the transformations (24)?

if ∂′
This question has already been answered for the transformation (24a) in [25].
We resume the results by presenting them from a point of view that can be
applied to other transformations (24).

First, we notice that the transformation (24a), x′ = N xeN , implies

∆ = ¯N ∆′ ˆN ,

(54)

14

where ∆ has been deﬁned in Eq. (37).
Second, we introduce the transformation (54) in Eq. (53a) and ask the result
to be equivalent to

M −1

E (γµ ∂′

µ ± i m′) ME |φ >± .

If so, by applying ME on the left of Eq. (55), this implies, at least for the six
Lorentz transformations, that

The key is to ensure that

m′ = m, |φ′i± = ME |φi±.

γµ ME ∂′

µ = ME γµ ∂µ,

µ being given by Eq. (54). As easily checked, this is satisﬁed with ME

with ∂′
given by Eq. (29a).
As an example, let us consider the rotation

x′0 = x0
x′1 = x1
x′2 = cos θ x2 + sin θ x3
x′3 = − sin θ x2 + cos θ x3



The constraint (57) leads then to

(cid:26) γ0 ME = ME γ0, γ1 ME = ME γ1

γ2 ME = ME (γ2 cos θ + γ3 sin θ), γ3 ME = ME (−γ2 sin θ + γ3 cos θ).

These relations are indeed satisﬁed with

ME = cos

θ

γ2γ3.

The same results hold true for each of the six Lorentz transformations.
2 θ I4 is a bit trickier. Indeed,
The case of the supplementary operator ME = e
in this case, as x′ = x, ∆′ = ∆, we have two possibilities: either m′ = m and
|φ′i± = |φi± or m′
6= m and |φ′i± = ME |φi±. The ﬁrst possibility is the
only one allowed by the traditional way of seeing while the second possibility
is typical of the geometric algebra point of view which is richer compared to
the usual one because the subtended group GL(2, C) has more parameters

than the Lorentz one.
It seems to us much more logical to favor this second possibility for reasons
of consistency as, for the Lorentz transformations, we precisely have |φ′i± =
ME |φi± each time. We therefore opt for, in all cases

We also notice that, for ME = e

|φ′i± = ME |φi±.

and ﬁnally obtain

What this tells us is that the mass itself undergoes a transformation, which
consists of a rotation in the complex plane. For θ = π, these rotations lead
to an inversion of the sign of the mass.
As noticed in [25], the relations (62) lead to diﬀerent transformation laws for
each spinor of |φi±

In what concerns the version coming from the geometric algebra, it is easy
to convince ourselves that

|ξ′i± = N |ξi± ; |η′i± = bN |ηi±.

Let us now turn, in a similar way, to the other cases (24c), (24b) and (24d).
First, we consider the proper retrochronous transformations. At the start,
we observe a simple change of sign through Eq. (24c) and

φ′
ǫ = ME φǫ ; ǫ = ±1.

∆ = − ¯N ∆′ ˆN .

This leads to anticommutation relations where there were commutation re-
lations and vice versa. In particular, Eq. (59) now reads

(cid:26) γ0 MIE = −MIE γ0, γ1 MIE = −MIE γ1

γ2 MIE = −MIE (γ2 cos θ + γ3 sin θ), γ3 MIE = MIE (γ2 sin θ − γ3 cos θ)

MIE = −i sin

γ0γ1γ2γ3 = −i I4 ME,

(69)

as expected.
This change of sign is also recovered for the supplementary symmetry in the
sense that we now have

γµ MIE = −M −1

IE γµ.

Despite this change of sign, the relation (64) still holds true.
In what concerns the results (65) and (66), they become respectively

and

|ξ′i± = N |ξi± ; |η′i± = − ˆN |ηi±,

φ′

ǫ = i MIE φǫ γ1γ2.

We now come to the improper orthochronous transformations characterized
by Eq. (24b). The transformation law on the derivatives is given by

∆ = eN ˆ∆′ N.

Each constraint on MO is aﬀected by sign changes. For instance, Eq. (59)
now reads

(cid:26) γ0 MO = MO γ0, γ1 MO = −MO γ1

γ2 MO = −MO (γ2 cos θ + γ3 sin θ), γ3 MO = MO (γ2 sin θ − γ3 cos θ)

and is satisﬁed with

MO = cos

in order to obtain the transformation law (64) on mass.
The results (65)-(66) are now

|ξ′i± = ˆN |ηi± ; |η′i± = N |ξi±.

We conclude this case by mentioning that

φ′

ǫ = ǫ MO φǫ γ0.

(78)

Let us now turn to the ultimate case, the one of improper retrochronous
transformations (24d). It is extremely close to the previous case. Eqs. (73)
and (74) just get a minus sign in front of the second member of each relation.
Consequently, we obtain

7 Conclusion

Usually, when one study the spacetime algebra, one focus to its even part,
isomorphic to the space algebra. This is because this even part allows to ﬁnd
the whole content of the Dirac equation. The relativistic invariance is then
that of the restricted Lorentz group.
We wanted to extend these considerations here by proposing three other

18

types of elements of this spacetime algebra, i.e. the odd and the imaginary
parts. This allowed us to highlight all connected components of the Lorentz
group.
We then linked these developments to the Dirac equation, with the two signs
of mass and conﬁrmed that the four propositions were associated with four
types of matter, of positive or negative mass, of positive or negative charge.
Each time, the Lorentz invariance was conﬁrmed but also completed by a
new transformation: a rotation in the complex plane concerning the mass
and thus allowing the inversion of the sign of this mass.
This supplementary transformation is due to the presence of the unit pseudo-
scalar of the STA. We are convinced that this pseudo-scalar unit could bring
other interesting developments. For example, we know that the mass term
of the usual Dirac Lagrangian, m ¯φφ, is purely scalar. But what happens to
this mass term in its geometric algebra version? We just have to take again
Eq. (49) and Eq. (51) simultaneously on the form

as well as

to see that

What is remarkable in Eq. (85) is the combination of both scalar and pseudo-
scalar contributions

m ¯φǫ φǫ = c1 + c2 I4,

a fact that was absent from traditional considerations since

m ¯φφ = m hφ|γ0|φi = m c1.

We believe that a mass acquisition process ”`a la Higgs” applied to Eq. (85)
could bring interesting developments and this is what we will work on in the
future.
