Abstract From our exact solution of the Janus Cosmolog-
ical equation we derive the relation of the predicted magni-
tude of distant sources versus their red shift. The compari-
son, through this one free parameter model, to the available
data from 740 distant supernovae shows an excellent ﬁt.

1 Introduction

Modern cosmology is facing quizzical observational data.
One of them is the acceleration of expansion of the uni-
verse (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1998; Schmidt et al.
1999). Scientists are then facing two choices:
• They either limit their interpretation of the phenomenon
within the geometrical frame issued from the complete
Einstein’s ﬁeld equation, including the so-called cosmo-
logical constant Λ. Therefore the price to pay for it, is to
add the concept of dark energy, whose physical nature re-
mains a complete mystery. On top of that, this creates a
model with a lot of free parameters giving it the nature of
ad hoc model.

• Or they have to deal with a drastic geometric and paradig-
matic change which extends General Relativity to a wider
model. This very model includes negative mass and neg-
ative energy particles whose physical nature can be de-
scribed through the dynamic groups theory. These parti-
cles are simple copies of our classical matter and antimat-
ter, with negative mass. Moreover, such a model, inspired
by Andrei Sakharov’s ideas, does explain why we do not
observe any primeval antimatter.

2 The Janus Cosmological model,

a necessary new geometrical framework

The JCM is based on the introduction of negative mass
and negative energy in the cosmological model. As shown
in 1957 by Bondi (1957) and conﬁrmed later by Bonnor
(1989), the introduction of negative masses in the GR model
produced an unmanageable runaway effect.

This effect comes from the usual way we deal with a par-
ticle embedded in a gravitational ﬁeld where particles follow
the same geodesic whatever positive or negative their mass
would be. As a conclusion, from Einstein’s equation:
• A positive mass object does attract any positive or nega-
tive mass.
• A negative mass object does repel any positive or negative
mass.

If, as an example, we are taking two opposite masses: the
positive one is escaping from the following chasing nega-
tive one. Both are experiencing a uniform acceleration. But
the energy is conserved because the negative mass carries a
negative energy.

This unmanageable feature banished negative mass con-
cept during 60 years. But this effect vanishes when we

consider that positive and negative masses follow differ-
ent geodesic systems, which both derived from both distinct
metric tensor ﬁelds g(+)
μν . These two are meant to
be solution of a coupled ﬁeld equations system and the JCM
brings the solution (Petit 1994, 1995; Petit and D’Agostini
2014a,b). See Hossenfelder (2006, 2008) for corresponding
Lagrangian derivation of such bimetric system.

The corresponding interaction scheme is the following:
• Positive masses do attract each other, though Newton’s
law.
• Negative masses do attract each other, though Newton’s
law.
• Opposed masses do repel each other, through anti-New-
ton’s law.

This interaction scheme ﬁts the action-reaction principle.

3 The beneﬁt of the JCM model

JCM is not another extra model with a lot of puzzling com-
ponents, associated with a subsequent set of free parameters.
It’s a model without unknown components.

Indeed, it is nothing else but an extension of Andrei

Sakharov’s ideas (Sakharov 1967, 1979, 1980).

In 1967 Andrei Sakharov gave an explanation of the ob-
servational absence of primeval antimatter (nowadays there
still is no other challenging theory). At the time, he thought
the universe to be composed by two “twin universes”, both
only linked together via one singularity “origin”. Inspired
from a CPT symmetry scheme, Sakharov suggested that:
• The arrow of
(T-symmetry).
• It would be enantiomorphic (P-symmetry).
• It would contain antimatter (C-symmetry).
JCM globally follows this above general scheme, but, in-
stead of two distinct universes, we suggest to consider one
single universe corresponding to a manifold M4 with two
metrics. This corresponds to a new, but clear, geometrical
framework.

time would be antiparallel

to ours

As shown by Souriau (1970) T-symmetry goes with en-
ergy and mass inversion, so that the “twin universes content”
only corresponds to a copy of our particles (photon, proton,
neutron, electron, up to quarks and their anti), but with neg-
ative energy and negative mass if any.

Negative masses emit negative energy photons, therefore
this matter is invisible to us. It only reveals its presence
through (anti) gravitational effects.

So that:

Following A. Sakharov, we can assume that the ratio of
the rate of production of baryon versus antibaryons would
be inverse for the negative population.
• JCM explains the absence of observation of the so-called
primeval antimatter, opposite to the mainstream ΛCDM
model.
• JCM describes precisely the nature of the invisible com-
ponents of the universe, opposite to the mainstream
ΛCDM model.
• In addition, JCM predicts that the antimatter produced in
laboratory will react as the matter with respect to the grav-
itational ﬁeld of the Earth (it will fall).
• Because positive and negative matter are repelling each
other, the negative matter content in the solar system is
almost zero. So, JCM ﬁts the classical relativistic obser-
vations, as presented in former papers (Petit 1995; Petit
and D’Agostini 2014a,b).
• JCM suggests a clear scheme for VLS formation (El-Ad
et al. 1996) when the mainstream ΛCDM model seems to
struggle more to give one.
• JCM explains the observed repellent effect due to “the
Great Repeller” (Hoffman et al. 2017). The measured es-
cape velocities of galaxies are due to the presence of an
invisible repellent cluster made of negative mass in the
centre of a big void. The mainstream model’s supporters
suggest that such a repellent effect could be due to some
kind of hole in the dark matter ﬁeld of the universe (pos-
itive masses). But, if the gravitational instability leads to
the setting up of massive clusters, it does not provide any
scheme for such void formations. So that the mainstream
ΛCDM model does not provide any explanation for this
observation.
• JCM explains the conﬁnement of galaxies and the shape
of their rotation curves. As we showed in Petit et al.
(2001), if one introduces a surrounding repellent negative
matter environment, it gives larger rotation velocities at
distance, see Fig. 1. Mysterious dark matter is no longer
required, while the mainstream ΛCDM model does.
• After JCM, the intensity of the observed gravitational
lensing effect is mainly due to the negative matter that
surrounds galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Mysterious
dark matter is no longer required, while the ΛCDM model
does.
• JCM suggests an explanation of the low magnitude of
very young galaxies: this would be due to negative lens-
ing weakening, when their light are crossing the negative
mass clusters located at the center of the big void. Myste-
rious dark matter is no longer required, while the ΛCDM
model does.

Both MB , α and β are nuisance parameters in the dis-

tance estimate.

We took the values given in Betoule et al. (2014) corre-
sponding to the best ﬁt of the whole set of combined data
(740 supernovae) with ΛCDM model.
With our best ﬁt, we have: χ 2/d.o.f. = 657/738

(740 points and 2 parameters).

The corresponding curves are shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, in
excellent agreement with the experimental data. The com-
parison with both model best ﬁts are shown in Fig. 7.

We can derive the age of the universe (see Appendix B)
with respect to q0 and H0 and some numerical values are
given in Table 1, for different (q0, H0) values. For our best
ﬁt, we get:
T0 = 1.07

Fig. 2 Spiral structure in numerical simulation

• JCM explains the spiral structure of galaxies (Petit et al.
2001), see Fig. 2, due to dynamical friction with the sur-
rounding negative mass. The ΛCDM model don’t give
any model explaining the spiral structure.
As a conclusion JCM is deﬁnitively not a simple or pure
speculative product of theoretical mathematics. It had been
compared with many observations and happened to ﬁt with
them. Opposite to the today’s mainstream ΛCDM model,
JCM does not carry unknown and mystery like dark matter
or dark energy.

5 What is missing

Let’s ﬁgure out that, when extended to the early age of
the universe, the JCM proposes an alternative to the inﬂa-
tion theory, in order to justify the great homogeneity of the
primeval universe. This was introduced ﬁrst in 1988 (Petit
1988), extended in 1995 (Petit 1995), and implies a variable
constants system which preserves all equations of physics.
As a basis of the interpretation of the very large structure of
the universe we supposed that the mass density of the neg-
ative species (negative mass ’twin’ matter) is much higher
that the one of the positive species.

In JCM, we have to take into account two systems, each
owing their own sets of “variable constants” plus space and
(cid:6)
time scale factors:
c(+), G(+), h(+), m(+), e(+), a(+), t (+)
(cid:6)
c(−), G(−), h(−), m(−), e(−), a(−), t (−)

(cid:7)
(cid:7)

A future work will show how, the system of coupled ﬁeld
equations (1) including a variable constants process, starting
from a fully symmetrical initial situation can explain density
instabilities.

(cid:6)
Moreover, when the densities get weaker, the sets:
c(+), G(+), h(+), m(+), e(+)
(cid:6)
c(−), G(−), h(−), m(−), e(−)

in each sector, with

The ΛCDM model provides an interpretation of the ﬂuc-
tuations of the CMB. If the JCM wants to pretend to chal-
lenge the ΛCDM it must provide an alternative interpreta-
tion of such observational data.

This is out of the scope of the present paper and will the

subject of future works.

6 Conclusion

Based on a new geometrical framework the JCM models
taking into account many observational data. It precisely de-
ﬁnes the nature of the invisible components of the universe,
as a copy of ordinary components, with negative energy and
negative mass, if any. By developing former Sakharov’s the-
ory, it explains the lack of primeval antimatter observation.
The negative sector is then composed with negative mass
protons, neutrons, electrons and so on. Through such a neg-
ative energy, photons make all negative sectors species in-
visible to us.

JCM model is explaining the strong gravitational lens-
ing effects around galaxies and clusters of galaxies, due to
the surrounding and conﬁning negative mass environment. It
brings a model for VLS formation, spiral structure and gives
an explanation to the repellent phenomena recently observed
in a very large size mapping. It also explains the ﬂatness of
the rotation curves of galaxies.

The extension of JCM to a variable constants regime, ap-
plying to the early stage, explains the homogeneity of the
early universe.

It brings an exact solution in the dust era, which takes into
account the acceleration of the universe. This paper is will-
ing to demonstrate the good agreement of this solution with
a single free parameter, with the experimental data on super-
novae. The deceleration parameter q0, always negative, hap-
pened to be small and there is no need in JCM to introduce
a non zero cosmological constant to ﬁt the so far available
data.

It is also pointed out that the model must now provide
its own interpretation of additional features like the CMB
ﬂuctuations.

In terms of the time t used in the FRLW metric, the light
emitted by Ge at time te is observed on G0 at a time t0 (te >
t0) and the distance l traveled by photons (ds2 = 0) is related
to the time difference t and then to the u parameter through
the relation:
