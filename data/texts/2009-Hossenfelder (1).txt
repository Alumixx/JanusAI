Antigravitation

Abstract. We discuss why there are no negative gravitational sources in General Relativity and
show that it is possible to extend the classical theory such that repulsive gravitational interaction
occurs. This is the summary of a talk given at the 17th International Conference on Supersymmetry
and the Uniﬁcation of Fundamental Interactions in Boston, June 2009.

WHY NO NEGATIVE GRAVITATIONAL CHARGES?

In General Relativity (GR) the gravitational charge of the source, its energy, is always
positive. If one considers the Newtonian potential describing the interaction between
two point masses, it seems straightforward to introduce negative gravitational masses:
to obtain a repulsive interaction, just change the sign of one of the masses. Unlike
Electrodynamics which is mediated by a spin-1 ﬁeld, the gravitational interaction is
transmitted by a spin-2 ﬁeld, thus like charges will attract and unlike charges repel.

So far, so good. But if one takes into account the motion of a testparticle in a
gravitational background ﬁeld, one knows that this curve, a geodesic, is independent of
the mass of the particle. If the curve does not depend on the particle’s mass then a particle
of negative gravitational mass, henceforth called ‘antigravitating,’ would fall towards a
gravitating source of either kind. One then had a situation in which a gravitating and an
antigravitating particle did both, attract and repel [1]; a scenario that is very implausible.
Another common objection to antigravitation is that the existence of negative masses
would allow for inﬁnite production of particle pairs. Because energy conservation does
not forbid production of a zero net sum out of nothing, a disastrous vacuum decay would
result. While this is a quantum effect and the following discusses a merely classical
scenario, it is a serious concern that will be brieﬂy addressed later.

A frequently occurring misunderstanding stems from the deﬁnition of antigravitation,
so some words of clariﬁcation are in order. Antigravitation has sometimes been used [2]
to mean a repulsive gravitational interaction between particles and their antiparticles.
While experimental data on the gravitational interaction of antiparticles is not entirely
conclusive, a different gravitational behavior of antiparticles is from a quantum ﬁeld
theoretical perspective not very plausible. What is here referred to as antigravitating
particles instead is an entirely new type of matter that, in the simplest case, would be
a copy of the Standard Model (SM). These particles are identical to the particles of the
SM except for their gravitational interaction. They attract each other but repel our usual
matter.

The gravitating and antigravitating particles interact only gravitationally. Thus, not

only would the antigravitating matter be dark, the interaction is also too weak for these
particles to be produced in experiments on Earth. Such matter would be detectable
only by its gravitational effects. Since it was repelled by our normal matter during the
formation of structures in the universe, one would not expect it to be present in our
vicinity in sizeable amounts. It would instead collect in what we think are voids.

We will in the following propose such an extension of GR with negative gravitational
charges based on the assumption that the antigravitating particles are just like the com-
mon particles, and that exchanging both sorts of particles would not alter the physics.
We are thus postulating a symmetry between gravitating and antigravitating particles.
This does not necessarily mean though that the amount of both types of matter in our
universe is the same.

Since we know from cosmological and astrophysical observations that our under-
standing of the matter content of the universe and/or its gravitational dynamics is incom-
plete, such a symmetry is appealing for both theoretical as well as experimental reasons.
It is thus not surprising it has been studied before in various approaches [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
The scenario outlined in the following, and explained in more detail in [9], has the virtue
of being entirely covariant and not allowing vacuum decay because it does not necessi-
tate negative kinetic energies.

HOW TO ADD NEGATIVE GRAVITATIONAL CHARGES

As discussed above, an antigravitating particle that moves on a geodesic is implausible.
However, a geodesic is uniquely deﬁned only through the connection employed, and the
connection itself is uniquely deﬁned only by requiring it to be torsion-free and metric-
compatible. Since torsion does not affect geodesics, one wants a second connection that
is torsion-free but not metric-compatible. To that end, introduce a second metric h over
the manifold, and construct a second derivative, denoted h(cid:209)
, that is compatible, not
with the usual metric g, but with the second metric h. The antigravitating particles will
feel a background with distance measures deﬁned by the second metric and move on
geodesics deﬁned according to this metric. With this derivative one can then deﬁne a
second curvature tensor and its contractions as usual.

We refer in the following to the antigravitating (normally gravitating) ﬁelds, particles
and observers as h-ﬁelds, h-particles, h-observers etc (g-ﬁelds, g-particles, g-observers).
It is straightforward to write down a Lagrangian for the h-ﬁelds by replacing the usual
metric with the second metric and the usual derivative with the corresponding second
derivative. One should not forget to also replace the volume-element, since otherwise
Gauss’s law cannot be applied and the equations of motion one obtains are not symmetric
to the usual ones. For a massless scalar h-ﬁeld f

the action then looks like

S =Z d4xp−

nk

h h

(h)(cid:209)

k f (h)(cid:209)

n f

.

These h-ﬁelds are tensors over the manifold and can be expanded in a local basis of the
tangential space. However, there is no tool to contract the basis of the tangential space
in which the h-ﬁelds are expanded with those of the g-ﬁelds. The local bases of both
spaces are trivially isomorphic in each point, but they cannot be directly compared to

tell whether they are indeed the same. This is conceptually similar to Special Relativity.
We have two observers. Here, one is constituted or normal matter, the other one of anti-
gravitating matter. They do both describe their physics in tensor equations and we know
these equations have the same form for both observers. Yet to compare them, we need to
ﬁnd a transformation from one set of observables to the other. These transformations to
pull over the tensors of the antigravitating observer to that of the normally gravitating,
and vice versa we will call the ‘pull-overs.’

The pull-overs do assign observables for h-ﬁelds to the g-observer, and observables
for g-ﬁelds to the h-observer. By this, they do preserve the tensor structure of objects, and
also the covariance of derivatives. In particular, for the g-observer they assign a 2-tensor
h = Ph(h) to the second metric h, and similarly the h-observer assigns a pulled-over
2-tensor g = Pg(g) to our metric g. Note underlines. The underlined quantities are the
observables of the h-observer, but cannot be observed directly by the g-observer. Only
after applying the pull-over are they converted into standard tensor-ﬁelds. The situation
is the same the other way round.

We further deﬁne a map a that transforms the one metric into the pull-over of the other

Since both g and h are symmetric, a is not completely determined by (2). We ﬁx the
remaining six degrees of freedom by requiring it to be symmetric, i.e. gkn ae
=

. We can pull over a by

n = aek

gel = a

e = [Pg]

e a

n

e (cid:2)Ph(cid:3)

,

gel = a

l hnk

which then gives the relation

This pulled-over quantity is also required to be symmetric. It is further useful to deﬁne
a combination of a and the pull-overs that maps g to h via

n
e = a

gel = a

.

And by raising and lowering some indices we also have

gel = a

, hnk = a

n aek

e

This introduced map a is a convenience and not an independent dynamical ﬁeld, since it
is deﬁned by relating g to Ph(h).

Now that the basics of the bi-metric formalism is in place, the ﬁeld equations need
to be found to determine the equations of motion for the second metric. We thus
extend Einstein’s ﬁeld equations by adding a negative source term constituted of the
antigravitating type of matter. Then, making use of the symmetry principle, we add a
second set of equations for the second metric. For this metric, it is the h-source that has
the usual sign, whereas our g-ﬁelds have the negative sign.

However, if one simply does this, the system of equations is over-constrained due to
the contracted Bianchi identities. These two times four equations require the additional

source terms to be covariantly conserved, yet there are no more degrees of freedom left.
The reason for this inconsistency is the neglect to pull over the source terms which adds
additional degrees of freedom. Together with the requirement of torsion-free-ness the
pull-overs provide the missing two times four degrees of freedom. In special cases, the
pull-overs are just the identity but in general they are non-trivial. The ﬁeld equations
then read

Also note the factors converting the measures of the stress-energy tensors in Eqs. (7,8),
since they are densities.

There is an action principle from which the above equation can be derived [9]. Though
the constrained space of this summary is insufﬁcient for more details, it should be
mentioned that the action does not have any negative kinetic energy terms. The minus
sign in the source term stems from the variation over the both metrics, together with the
requirement that the variation of the a’s vanishes, i.e. d ank
= 0. The change of
sign thus appears only for the sources of the gravitational ﬁeld. It does not appear if one
takes the variation with respect to the ﬁelds which provides the stress-energy that can be
considered a generalization of ‘inertial’ mass. Then, to ﬁnally come back to the concern
about an unstable vacuum, both the gravitational and the inertial mass of particles is
conserved separately which means in particular it is not possible to produce a pair of
gravitating and anti-gravitating particles out of the vacuum.

Note added: A no-go theorem for bi-metric gravity with positive and negative mass
was recently put forward in [10]. It has been shown in [11], that this does not affect the
here discussed model.
