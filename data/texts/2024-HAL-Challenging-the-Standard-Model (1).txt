In  the  early  1970s,  measurements  of  rotation  velocities  in  galaxies  became  increasingly 
precise.  Vera  Rubin  published  a  series  of  papers,  and  by  the  end  of  the  decade  the 
conclusion was clear [6]: the rotational motions of galaxies were far from consistent with 
Kepler's  law.  Astrophysicists  deduced  that  a  very  large  quantity  of  matter  produced  the 
gravitational field opposing the centrifugal force linked to rotational motion. They gave it a 
name:  dark  matter.  All  possible  models  were  then  considered  to  clarify  its  nature,  both 
observationally  and  with  regard  to  new  particles.  Measurements  of  gravitational  lensing 
effects  in  the  vicinity  of  galaxies  and  clusters  confirm,  in  the  minds  of  theorists,  that  this 
matter  does  indeed  exist.  But  half  a  century  later,  no  credible  model  is  available.  In  this 
second  field,  the  neutron's  sister  particle,  the  neutralino,  in  a  new  theory  based  on 
supersymmetry, seems to be the most credible candidate. But it refuses to appear, whether 
in experiments conducted in large particle accelerators, in mines and tunnels, or aboard the 
International  Space  Station,  in  cosmic  rays.  This  failure  went  hand  in  hand  with  the 
stagnation  of  observations  in  particle  physics,  as  the  existence  of  no  particle  of  this  new 
symmetry  could  be  demonstrated.    Anyway,  cosmologists  modified  their  model,  which 
became known as the CDM (cold dark matter) model. The term “cold” implies that this dark 
matter is driven by velocities that are  small with respect to the speed of light. From 1988 
onwards, new satellites made it possible to map the CMB, which has been refined over the 
years. The CMB now appears homogeneous to the nearest hundred thousandth. This raises a 
new  paradox.  Where  could  such  homogeneity  emerge  from 
in  a  non-collisional 
environment? There are two possible interpretations. Either it is due to a fantastic expansion 
[7],  a new field to which a new particle is associated : the inflaton, either  it comes from a 
mechanism in which all constants vary jointly [8], [9] the secular variation of the speed of 
light making the cosmological horizon follow very exactly the evolution of the space scale 
factor of the universe. But thirty-six years later, there are as many inflaton models as there 
are researchers working on the subject. 
Finally,  in  2011  ([10],[11],[12]),  a  Nobel  Prize  was  awarded  for  a  new  discovery:  the 
acceleration of the cosmic expansion. This phenomenon is attributed to the presence of the 
cosmological  constant  in  the  field  equation,  without  being  able  to  identify  its  physical 
nature.  We  simply  introduce  the  additional  term  “dark  energy”,  also  of  an  unidentified 
nature.  By  converting  this  energy  into  mass  using  the  mc2  relation,  we  obtain  a  new 
distribution,  where  ordinary  matter  is  the  only  one  suitable  for  observations.  The 
cosmological constant L is incorporated into the model, which is now called the Standard 
Model LCDM.

2 – The emergence of a crisis in cosmology and astrophysics. 

 The	Einstein’s	model,	born	in		1915	survive	until	2017	with	:	
	
-  An	inflation	field		
-  Dark	matter.	
-  Dark	energy.		
	
In	2017,	four	researchers	-	Hélène	Courtois,	Daniel	Pomarède,	Brent	Tully	and	Yeudi	
Hoffman	-	created	a	map	of	the	universe	[13]	in	a	cube	one	and	a	half	billion	light-years	
across,	with	the	Milky	Way	at	its	center.	The	Doppler	effect	provides	the	escape	
velocities	of	galaxies,	and	thus	the	Hubble	velocity	field.	By	subtracting	this	field,	the	
authors	obtain	the	proper	velocities	of	the	objects.	The	result	is	a	dipolar	velocity	field.	
At	one	end	is	a	formation	containing	a	hundred	thousand	galaxies,	the	Shapley	attractor.	
At	the	other	end,	six	hundred	million	light-years	from	the	Milky	Way,	we	discover	an	
immense	void	one	hundred	million	light-years	across,	the	Dipole	Repeller,	which	repels	
all	surrounding	matter.	Some	astrophysicists	have	suggested	that	this	may	reflect	the	
presence	of	an	equivalent	void	in	the	general	distribution	of	dark	matter.	But	this	
doesn't	provide	the	solution,	as	gravitational	instability	within	this	positive-mass	dark	
matter	would	create	conglomerates,	not	voids.		
	

	Today,	in	2024,	observation	has	revealed	the	existence	of	a	handful	of	similar	large	
voids.	No	theory	has	been	proposed	to	explain	their	existence.	
	A	few	years	later,	the	first	images	from	the	JWST	appeared.	They	caused	a	panic	among	
the	scientific	community,	as	the	title	of	the	reference	[14]	suggests.	Successive	images

show	that	barred,	fully-formed	spiral	galaxies,	harboring	stars	that	are	already	old,	exist	
at	an	epoch	(prior	to	the	first	five	hundred	million	years)	where	the	standard	model	
cannot	place	them.	Within	this	model	framework,	it	is	necessary	to	assign	parameters	to	
dark	matter	that	allow	us	to	model	the	birth,	first	of	mini-galaxies,	and	then,	through	
their	accretion,	of	galaxies	as	we	observe	them	today.	What	slows	down	this	formation	
by	gravitational	instability	is	the	fact	that	any	accretion	leads	to	the	heating	of	matter	by	
compression.	This	thermal	energy,	resulting	from	the	conversion	of	gravitational	energy,	
must	be	able	to	be	evacuated	by	radiation.	But	for	an	object	of	radius	R,	the	amount	of	
heat	to	be	evaluated	is	the	cube	of	this	radius,	while	its	radiator,	its	surface	area,	is	the	
square	of	R.	So	cooling	time	increases	with	mass.	So	it	was	thought	that	mini-galaxies	
would	have	to	form	first,	as	these	would	merge	to	produce	the	more	massive	galaxies.	
We	therefore	expected	to	find	a	mass	of	mini-galaxies,	not	fully-formed,	adult	galaxies,	
for	the	youngest,	high-redshift	objects.	
	By	focusing	on	the	analysis	of	the	weak	fluctuations	observed	in	the	CMB,	the	specialists	
had	deduced	a	spectrum	of	these	fluctuations,	attributed	to	a	gravito-acoustic	
mechanism.		The	modeling	of	these	fluctuations	was	based	on	a	choice	of	numerous	
parameters	of	different	kinds,	linked	among	other	things	to	the	invisible	components	of	
the	universe.	Among	these	choices	was	the	value	assigned	to	Hubble's	constant.	The	
curve	fit	required	a	value	of	67	kms-1	Mpc-1.	However,	the	value	deduced	from	direct	
measurements	is	different:	70	kms-1	Mpc-1.	
	Since	this	phenomenon	was	first	demonstrated,	it	has	been	known	as	Hubble	tension.	A	
new	element	of	disagreement.		
	
Observation	constantly	provides	new	elements	that	the	standard	model	cannot	account	
for.		In	2022,	a	method	based	on	MgII	absoption	of	the	light	emitted	by	quasars	in	the	
background	revealed	an	immense	arc	of	galaxies	[15]	and	galaxy	clusters	at	z	=	0.8,	at	a	
distance	of	three	and	a	half	billion	light-years.	In	2024,	these	same	researchers	
discovered	an	immense	ring	[16]	1.3	billion	light-years	in	diameter,	which	they	named	
the	Big	Ring,	located	9.2	billion	years	away.	No	explanation	for	the	existence	of	such	
formations	has	yet	been	found.	
	When	the	scientific	community	is	confronted	with	a	problem,	it	immediately	comes	up	
with	a	new	word.	Inflation	leads	to	the	word	inflaton.	A	very	good	example	can	be	found	
in	an	article	published	in	2021	by	the	prestigious	English	magazine	Monthly	Notice.	In	
this	article,	the	essential	component	of	the	hypermassive	object	at	the	center	of	the	
Milky	Way	is	named:	a	compact	mass	of	...	darkinos!	This	practice	is	actually	quite	
common.	In	1964,	when	the	mathematician	proposed	extending	the	cosmological	model	
to	a	five-dimensional	space	[18],	his	work	revealed	an	unknown	scalar.	It	was	
immediately	given	a	name.	It's	the	dilaton!	
	Today,	we're	faced	with	a	wide	range	of	problems.		
	
	

We	pointed	out	the	conflicts	between	the	Standard	Model		

and	observations	with	the	color	brown.	

 

5 

Some	suggest	that	the	laws	of	physics	are	different	in	these	great	empty	regions.	Voices	
are	beginning	to	be	raised	suggesting	a	possible	paradigm	shift.	If	we	are	to	opt	for	such	
a	change,	the	new	model	must:		
	
-	Provide	alternative	explanations	for	all	the	phenomena	for	which	the	
standard	model	provided	an	explanation.	We	indicate	these	points	in	blue.		
	-	Account	for	phenomena	that	defeat	the	standard	model.	We'll	mark	these	
points	with	red.		
	Let's	list	them:	

- The absence of observations of cosmological antimatter 
- The nature of the invisible components of the universe 
- The reason for the non-observation of these same components 
- The explanation for the existence of large cosmic voids.  
- The early birth of stars and galaxies 

 
Add: an explanation, other than inflation, for the extreme uniformity of the CMB.  
 
 
3 – A system of two coupled field equations.  
 
The  geometric  paradigm  of  general  relativity  assimilates  the  universe  to  a  hyperbolic 
gµν
manifold, endowed with a metric 
. This universe contains curvatures that are reflected in 
 
R µν
the existence of a tensor field 
. Particles with mass then follow the non-zero geodesics 
 
gµν
  .  Photons  follow  zero-length  geodesics.  The  whole  is  the 
derived  from  this  metric 
 
solution of a field equation:

If we opt for

violation of the action-reaction principle. This is the runaway effect.

This same paradox was encountered when we tried to introduce negative masses into the 
general relativity model [15], which had a single metric. But in this new, bimetric model, the 
choice 
  allows  us  to  eliminate  it,  thus  obtaining  the  system  of  two  coupled  field 
equations of the Janus Cosmological Model (JCM).

By  introducing  the  metrics  (23a)  and  (23b)  into  the  system  (17a)  and  (17b)  we  obtain  an

And the exact solutions, for phases dominated by matter are:

Here we find a way of conforming to an observational datum. All we have to do is assume 
that  the  overall  energy  of  the  system  is  predominantly  negative.  Under  these  conditions, 
equation (29a) accounts for the acceleration of the cosmic expansion. This is an alternative 
interpretation to that given by the model, which attributes the phenomenon to the presence 
of  the  cosmological  constant.  There  is,  however,  an  important  difference:  the  standard 
model leads to an exponential acceleration, whereas in the interpretation provided by the 
Janus model, the acceleration tends towards zero at infinity. The expansion becomes linear 
at infinity. This solution has been successfully confronted with observational data [20].  
 
The Janus model is therefore profoundly asymmetrical. This has immediate consequences. 
At the moment of decoupling, the Jeans time characteristic of negative mass will be shorter:

Under  these  conditions,  this  population  will  give  rise  to  a  regular  set  of  spheroidal 
conglomerates that will confine the positive mass to the remaining space, giving it a lacunar 
structure. 
 
à The locations of these conglomerates will be marked by huge voids, the dipole repeller 
being one of them.  
 
à When this very large-scale structure is formed, the material will be compressed by the 
adjacent  negative-mass  conglomerates  and  will  heat  up.    But  its  geometry  will  allow 
radiative  cooling  to  take  place  just  as  rapidly.  Destabilized,  the  positive  mass  will 
immediately  give  rise  to  first-generation  stars,  clusters  and  galaxies,  predating  the  first 
hundred  million  years.  This  phenomenon  is  consistent  with  the  early  presence  of  fully-
formed galaxies.

Fig.4 : Rapid star and galaxy formation.  

 
Infiltrating  between  galaxies,  the  negative  mass  will  exert  a  counter-pressure  on  the 
galaxies, ensuring their confinement. This explains the flatness of the rotation curves at the 
periphery,  as  well  as  the  strong  gravitational  lensing  effects,  hitherto  attributed  to  the 
presence of a dark matter halo.  
 
This  negative  mass  replaces  both  dark  matter  and  dark  energy,  giving  us  the  following 
equivalent distribution:

which  is  not  identical  to  (38),  but  is  the  same  as  Euler's  equation  (40)  in  the  Newtonian 
approximation,  i.e.  when  the  terms  in 
  are  neglected.  Bianchi's  condition  is  therefore 
satisfied asymptotically.  
 
à Note that this Newtonian approximation corresponds to the vast majority of astrophysical 
phenomena.  
 
The geodesics outside the masses, the only ones that fall within the scope of our physics, i.e. 
that lead to measurements, are given by : 

(44)

This confirms the fact that positive mass repels negative mass and negative-energy photons.  
 
This is the case of the solar system. The first equation is then identified with Einstein's, with 
no cosmological constant. In this way, the model satisfies the classic verifications of general 
relativity: Mercury's perihelion is advanced, and light rays are deflected by the mass of the 
Sun.  
 
But there are objects that fall outside this approximation. These are :  
 
- Neutron stars 
- Hypermassive objects located at the center of galaxies. 
 
In  these  cases,  a  Newtonian  solution  is  not  appropriate.  The  conditions  of  mathematical 
compatibility  only  apply  to  geometries  inside  masses.  A  The  metric  then  has  the  non-
linearized form:

The  metric  giving  the  geodesics  outside  this  hyperdense  positive  mass  is  the  classical 
Schwarzschild outer metric:

We are then under no obligation to provide the expression of the interaction tensor 
. This 
form,  after  applying  Newtonian  approximation,  should  simply  tend  to  the  Euler  equation 
(40). We can thus conclude that the system of field equations (10a) , (10b) can be used to 
describe the geometry inside and outside a positive mass, even a hyperdense one.

This corresponds to the geometry of the dipole repeller, which is linked to the presence of a 
negative-mass  spheroidal  object.  These  are  the  first  objects  to  form,  immediately  after 
decoupling.  This  phenomenon  leads  to  spheroidal  objects,  which  then  heat  up.  The 
constituent atoms ionize, stopping the contraction. These objects can then be compared to 
immense protostars, whose cooling time exceeds the age of the universe..  
 
Objects at the center of large voids, of which the dipole repeller is an example, are immense 
spheroidal  masses  of  atoms  which,  when  brought  to  the  ionization  temperature  of  the 
medium, radiate in the red and infrared. These structures do not evolve. They constitute the 
objects of the negative world, which is devoid of stars, galaxies and planets.  
 

à Life is therefore absent from this negative world. 

 
These structures, on the other hand, fall within the Newtonian approximation. We'll need to 
construct the metric which alone lends itself to observation. To do this, we need to produce 
tensors  that  satisfy  Bianchi's  conditions  for  asymptotically  zero  covariant  derivatives.  We 
propose:

These two metrics are connected to the surface of the star

). A prediction can be deduced from these two metrics. Sooner or later, 
astronomers will create a map showing the magnitudes of light emitted by objects located in 
the background of this dipole repeller zone.  
 
A weak but measurable negative lensing effect should then be apparent. The drawing below 
is for illustrative purposes only, and is an exaggeration of the effect.

As can be seen, the effect is greatest when the photons' trajectory skims the surface of the 
negative-mass  star.  It  then  tends  towards  zero  when  this  trajectory  passes  through  the 
center of the object.

an indication of the diameter of this invisible object.

8 – Primordial antimatter 
 
We know that there is currently no model to account for the absence of observed primordial 
antimatter.  Let's  take  up  the  idea  proposed  by  Andrei  Sakharov  in  1967  ([23],  [24]  ,[25]). 
Starting  from  the  violation  of  CP  symmetry,  he  hypothesized  the  existence  of  a  second 
universe, which he described as a Twin, linked to our own by the Big Bang singularity. 

 

19 

Fig.8 : 2D didactic image of the Sakharov universe. 

 

 

 

 
In this second universe, the violation of CP symmetry would be inverse. Overall, he proposes 
a CPT twin universe symmetrical with our own. In our own universe, matter is synthesized 
from quarks, while antimatter is synthesized from antiquarks. Sakharov therefore suggests 
that  in  our  universe,  the  synthesis  of  matter  from  quarks  would  have  been  slightly  faster 
than  the  synthesis  of  antimatter  from  antiquarks.  The  situation  is  reversed  in  the  second 
universe.  
 
The composition of our universe would therefore be : 

 
- Matter 
- A corresponding remnant of antiquarks in the free state 
- Photons from annihilations. 
 

And in a second universe:  

 
- Antimatter  
- A corresponding remnant of quarks in the free state 
- Photons from annihilations. 
 

This  is  the  only  proposal  currently  in  existence.  In  the  Janus  cosmological  model  [19],  we 
begin by exploiting one of the essential results of [26], chapter XIV, equation (14.66): the 
inversion  of  time  goes  hand  in  hand  with  the  inversion  of  mass  and  energy.  In  the  Janus 
cosmological model, we begin by identifying the contents of the Sakharov twin universe as 
negative-mass  antimatter,  associated  with  a  corresponding  remnant  of  negative-energy 
quarks  and  a  population  of  negative-energy  photons.  This  negative-mass  antimatter  is 
merely the image of our own, with mass changing sign. We can therefore say:  
 
à The invisible components of the universe are negative-mass antihydrogen and antihelium. 
Their invisibility is explained by the fact that they emit photons of negative energy, which 
cannot be captured by our observational instruments.  
 

 

20 

à  The  use  of  dynamical  group  theory  [19],  applied  to  the  Janus  model  (Janus  group), 
indicates that there are two types of antimatter.  
 
- An antimatter with positive mass C-symmetrical to our own matter, which we can produce 
in the laboratory. 
 
- A second type of antimatter, PT-symmetrical to our own matter, found between galaxies 
and in immense conglomerates of negative mass.  
 
à As predicted by the Janus model, and confirmed by experience, antimatter created in the 
laboratory behaves like ordinary matter, in the Earth's gravity field, and “falls down”. 
 
 
9 – Quantum mechanics and negative energy states.  
 
à As already pointed out in [19] , the non-existence of negative energy states is just one of 
the postulates of quantum field theory. We translate this by assuming a priori that the time-
reversal operator T must be antilinear and antiunitary. By freeing itself from this constraint, 
the Janus model suggests a necessary extension of Quantum Mechanics to these negative 
energy states, as outlined in ([27], [28]).  

à This “contradicts the CPT theorem”. But this is not a theorem, but an assertion based on 
the assumption that the T operator does not invert energy. The CPT motion symmetrical to 
that  of  a  matter  particle  corresponds  to  the  motion  of  its  antimatter,  affected  by  a  time 
inversion..  
 
All  attempts  to  quantify  the  gravitational  field  have  so  far  been  failures.  Although  no 
graviton  model  exists,  this  has  not  prevented  legions  of  researchers  from  taking  it  for 
granted. Thus, in reference [17], the authors report, in addition to a mass spectrum of these 
gravitons, the existence of a gap between light and heavy gravitons.   

We conjecture that the key to quantifying the gravity field lies in integrating negative masses 
into the model. When we set out to quantize the electromagnetic field, a process that gives 
rise  to  the  photon  as  an  exchange  particle,  we  take  into  account  the  shielding  effect 
associated  with  the  reaction  of  the  vacuum,  assimilated  to  a  mixture  of  matter  and 
antimatter. There's an analogy with kinetic plasma theory. The latter is managed using the 
Boltzmann equation, which has something in common with quantum mechanics in that it 
admits the existence of particles, but refrains from locating them individually, insofar as the 
velocity distribution function f is a probability of presence. The formalism involves integro-
differential  operators  whose  eigenvalues  are  the  effective  cross-sections  of  collisions.  To 
calculate these effective cross-sections, the force law is given as a function of the distance 

between the particles. Thus, a law in 

 leads to a constant value, which fits quite well with 

	1r5

, 
a “billiard ball” model of electrically neutral particles. Introducing an electric potential in 
Newtonian, early theorists were in for a nasty surprise: the effective cross-section became 
infinite. 

	1r

	1re−r/d

 
It was the Dutch physicist P. Debye who provided the key. By acting on its environment, a 

    where  d  is  the 
charged  particle  caused  a  shielding  effect,  the  potential  becoming 
Debye distance. Since then, the calculation of the integral giving the effective collision cross-
section has been limited to this d value.  With regard to the field created by an electrically 
charged particle, Quantum Mechanics also takes into account a shielding effect linked to the 
reaction  of  the  vacuum  to  it.  A  vacuum  then  assimilated  to  a  mixture  of  matter  and 
antimatter.  By  analogy,  we  conjecture  that  managing  a  vacuum  made  up  of  a  mixture  of 
masses of both signs would lead to a similar shielding effect, with the characteristic length 
becoming the Jeans length, and that the infinities encountered in any attempt to quantize 
the gravity field with a single type of mass would then disappear.   
 
 
10 – Topology of the Janus Model.  
 
In the Janus Cosmological Model (JCM) [19], these two types of matter are made to interact, 
folding the Sakharov universe in on itself..  
 

Fig.9: Didactic 2D image of the Janus model. 

 
At this point, the singularity can be replaced by a tube connecting the two universe folds.

à In this way, the Janus model makes the initial cosmological singularity disappear. 

 
But  we  could  do  more,  i.e.  start  from  a  closed  space-time,  whose  didactic  2D  image  is  a 
sphere S2:  
 

Fig.11 : 2D didactic image of a closed universe 

 
à  In  this  case,  the  space-time  hypersurface,  having  the  topology  of  an  S4  sphere,  is 
configured  according  to  the  two-sheet  covering  of  a  P4  projectf,  which  creates  this  PT-
symmetry between adjacent sheets. The Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities then coincide, 
and once again, by replacing them with a tube, these singularities disappear and the object 
becomes the two-sheet covering of a four-dimensional Klein bottle. The universe undergoes 
a moment of maximum extension, then contracts.  
 
à  This  topology  does  away  with  the  question  of  a  “pre-Big  Bang”  and  “post-Big  Crunch” 
universe. The universe is not “created”, it “is”.

11 – Galaxy model. 
 
Galaxies are collections of masses orbiting both in their own gravitational field and in the 
field produced by their negative-mass surroundings.  
 
To date, only semi-empirical models of galaxies exist. A mathematically correct model should 
be  based  on  an  exact  solution  of  the  Vlasov  equation.  In  this  respect,  we  only  have 

S.Chandrasekhar's exploitation [31]	of the solution represented by the spherical Maxwell-

Boltzmann distribution function, where Log f is a spherical polynomial as a function of the U, 
V, W components of the residual velocity, the astrophysical analogy of the thermal agitation 
velocity.  This  model  has  been  proposed  to  describe  spheroidal  objects  such  as  globular 
clusters. But one of the difficulties is that the mass of such structures is infinite. An exact 
elliptical solution was proposed in the 1970s ([29],[30]), also leading to infinite mass. The key 
assumption  concerned  the  shape  of  the  velocity  ellipsoid,  hereafter  in  an  axisymmetric 
system.   

Fig.12 : Extract from reference [30]. Velocity ellipsoid. 

 
The Maxwell Boltzmann solution, with C denoting the residual velocity vector, is: 
 

mC22kT
	Logf = ϕ(r) −
mC22kH +a < C,r >

(

)

(61)                                                      

 
In steady state, the elliptical solution is: 
 

Logf = ϕ(r) −
		

(62)                                

+ α < C,k×r >

(

)

 

 
Constructing  the  solution  then  involves  determining  the  functions  H  , 
.  In  the 
diametral plane, the major axis of the ellipsoid points to the center of the system. At this 
point,  the  ellipsoid  becomes  a  velocity  sphere.  The  solution  shows  the  evolution  of  the 
ellipsoid's axes as a function of position. We find that the major axis is constant, while the 
transverse axes, which are equal in the diametral plane, tend towards zero at infinity.  Thus, 
in this plane, at a distance r from the center, we obtain a velocity ellipsoid whose major axis 

  and 

α

 

	a

points towards the center of the galaxy. Details of these calculations can be found in [29]. 
This aspect is consistent with the only measurement available, namely the determination of 
the velocity ellipsoid for the population of stars in the vicinity of the Sun, whose major axis 
tends  approximately  towards  the  galactic  center  and  whose  equal  transverse  axes  have 
values half that of the galactic center.   
 

This is the beginning of the confirmation of the model.  

 
The  density  is  then  obtained  by  solving  Poisson's  equation  numerically.  But  with  a  single 
population, the galaxy's total mass tends towards infinity. This mass becomes finite if the 
galaxy is surrounded by a distribution of negative mass, obeying a second Vlasov equation, 
where the distribution function is assumed to be of the Maxwell Boltzmann type. This work 
is currently under development.  
 
There is another aspect of galactic dynamics. Specialists in spiral structure are still looking for 
the mechanism that would allow it to maintain itself.  The Janus model shows that perennial 
spiral structures can be obtained, reflecting the way galaxies continuously transfer energy 
and  angular  momentum  to  their  negative-mass  surroundings.  In  collisional  environments, 
transport  occurs  from  close  to  close,  via  collisions.  This  type  of  dissipative  phenomenon 
cannot  arise  in  a  non-collisional  system.  Instead,  it  takes  place  via  gravity  waves,  which 
manifest  themselves  both  within  the  galaxy  and  in  its  negative-mass  environment. 
Simulations  have  shown  that  barred  spiral  formations  can  be  maintained  for  up  to  40 
revolutions [16]. 
 

Fig.13 : Loss of angular momentum. Numerical simulation [20] 

 

 

 
à The Janus model is therefore the only one that explains the origin of the galactic spiral 
structure as the manifestation of a dissipative density-wave phenomenon.

12 – Conclusion.  
 
Cosmology and astrophysics are currently facing a major crisis. Over the last five decades, 
specialists  have  attempted  to  integrate  new  observational  data  by  adding  two  ad  hoc 
components of unknown nature to the model - dark matter and dark energy - to form a new 
standard model. In recent years, however, other elements have emerged that the standard 
model is no longer able to account for. Essentially, the existence of huge voids in the large-
scale structure, and the early appearance of galaxies and first-generation stars. Perhaps it's 
time,  not  to  reject  a  new  creation  that  has  enabled  mankind  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  the 
universe, bringing with it so much richness, but to deploy it even more widely, opening the 
way to even more enlightening discoveries..
