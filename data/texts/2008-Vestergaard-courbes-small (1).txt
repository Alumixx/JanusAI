FIGURE 4. (Estimated) mass distribution of 14,584 quasar central engines (CEs) with z >
0.2, as functions of redshift z, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3, within an
effective sky area of 1644 deg?, taken from Vestergaard et al (2008). Squares denote median
masses in each redshift bin. The dashed curve indicates faint SDSS flux limits.
