massive	star	a	century	ago,	before	the	geometric	criticality	comes	into	play.	
On	this	basis,	a	new	model	has	been	built,	alternative	to	the	stellar	black	hole	
model,	describing	the	behavior	of	a	subcritical	neutron	star	destabilized	by	
an	excess	of	matter	incoming	from	a	companion	star.	The	"frozen	time"	issue,	
classically	associated	with	the	phenomenon,	is	dealt	by	taking	into	account	
frame-dragging	effects	due	to	the	rotation	of	the	object	in	the	Kerr	metric.

Introduction	
In	the	first	part	of	this	article,	we	have	re-examined	the	solution	to	the	
Einstein	field	equations	found	by	Karl	Schwarzschild	in	1916	[1]	from	a	
mathematical	angle,	showing	that	its	analytic	continuations	are	nothing	but	
extensions	into	a	purely	imaginary	realm.		
If	we	admit	this	idea	belongs	to	Physics,	then	we	must	take	into	account	all	
that	has	been	concocted	for	half	a	century	with	respect	to	this	"interior	of	
black	holes",	in	particular	their	"thermodynamics"	and	the	"central	
singularity".	As	for	the	alteration	of	the	metric	signature	going	from		 ( + − − − )	
to	 ( − + − − )	when	the	surface	of	the	event	horizon	is	crossed,	it	is	recalled	this	
is	conventionally	interpreted	by	saying	that	inside	the	black	hole,	t	becomes	
a	space	variable,	and	r	a	time.

Before	considering	a	real	extension	of	this	solution,	we	shall	consider	the	
second	paper	published	by	Schwarzschild	in	February	1916.	[2]	

Fig.	1	–	Karl	Schwarzschild's	second	paper,	24	February	1916:	"On	the	gravitational	
field	of	a	sphere	of	incompressible	fluid	according	to	Einstein's	theory."	
Since	this	essential	article	was	not	available	in	English	until	December	1999,	
[2]	it	is	quite	likely	that	black	hole	specialists	are	unaware	of	its	content,	and	
perhaps	even	its	existence.

In	equation	(3)	we	recognize	the	covariant	form	of	the	energy-momentum	
tensor.	In	(4)	its	trace.	And	just	below,	Einstein's	constant,	expressed	using	a	
speed	of	light	taken	equal	to	unity.	In	(5)	the	field	equation	Einstein	has	just	
published	a	few	months	earlier.

solution.	Equations	(9)	are	identical	to	the	choice	made	in	equation	(10)	of	
his	previous	paper.	He	specifies	that	α	and	ρ	are	arbitrary	constants	that	will	
have	to	be	determined	later,	using	the	mass	and	the	radius	of	the	star

2. About the equations of motion of a point of infinitely small mass 
outside our sphere, which maintain the same form as in “Mass point” 
(there equations (15)-(17)), one makes the following remarks: 

For  large  distances  the  motion  of  the  point  occurs  according  to 
Newton’s law, with α/2k2 playing the rôle of the attracting mass. Therefore 
α/2k2 can be designated as “gravitational mass” of our sphere. 

If one lets a point fall from the rest at infinity down to the surface of 

the sphere, the “naturally measured” fall velocity takes the value:  

va =

  

1
1− α
R

dR
ds = α
Ra   

	

Hence, due to (40): 

  va = sinχa   

For the Sun the fall velocity is about 1/500 the velocity of light. One 
easily satisfies himself that, with the small value thus resulting for χa and 
χ (< χa), all our equations coincide with the equations of Newton’s theory 
apart from the known second order Einstein’s effects.  

The	end	of	his	paper	has	our	undivided	attention.	The	angle	χ	allows	to	locate	
oneself	inside	the	sphere.	χ	=	0	is	the	geometric	center.	He	writes:	

4. The velocity of light in our sphere is 

2

 

cosχa − cosχ

v =
  

hence  it  grows  from  the  value  1/cos χa  at  the  surface  to  the  value 
2/(3cos χa − 1) at the center. The value of the pressure quantity ρ0 + p 
according to (10) and (30) grows in direct proportion to the velocity of 
light.  

Moreover:	

6	

	

Fig.	7	

7	

	

	
i.e.:	

i.e.:	

At the center of the sphere (χ = 0) velocity of light and pressure 
become infinite when cos χa = 1/3, and the fall velocity becomes 8/9 of the 
(naturally  measured)  velocity  of  light.  Hence  there  is  a  limit  to  the 
concentration, above which a sphere of incompressible fluid can not exist. 
If one would apply our equations to values cosχa < 1/3, one would get 
discontinuities already outside the center of the sphere. 

Finally,	note	the	last	sentence	of	the	paper:	

Fig.	8	

 Po =α 

For an observer measuring from outside it follows from (40) that a sphere of 
given gravitational mass α/2k2 can not have a radius measured from outside 
smaller than:  

For a sphere of incompressible fluid the limit will be 9/8 α. (For the Sun α is 
equal to 3 km, for a mass of 1 gram is equal to 1.5 · 10−28 cm.)  

A	physical	criticality	before	the	geometric	criticality	
Thus,	as	early	as	February	1916,	Karl	Schwarzschild	had	detected	that	a	
peculiar	situation	of	 physical	 criticality	(where	the	pressure	and	speed	of	
light	become	infinite	in	the	center	of	the	star)	manifests	itself	 before	the	
classical	geometric	criticality	is	reached	(when	the	radius	of	the	star	merges	
with	the	Schwarzschild	radius).	
From	his	article,	it	is	then	easy	to	calculate	the	value	of	the	pressure	as	a	
function	of	the	outer	radius	of	the	star.	

	
8	
This	corresponds	to	the	famous	equation	established	in	1939,	based	on	
Richard	Tolman's	work	[3],	by	J.	Robert	Oppenheimer	and	George	Volkoff	[4]	
which	is	the	basis	of	the	"TOV	model"	named	after	their	initials:		
	
This	TOV	model	considers,	like	Schwarzschild's	model	from	which	it	is	
derived,	a	neutron	star	as	a	sphere	of	constant	density.	
Fig.	9	is	a	line	graph	displaying	solution	curves	of	the	TOV	equation.	It	shows	
the	evolution	of	pressure	in	the	neutron	star	according	to	a	logarithmic	scale	
and	as	a	function	of	the	distance	from	the	center	of	the	star,	for	different	
values	of	its	outer	radius	Rn	(hence	its	mass):	

( ρ+ p )( m(r) + 4πk p r 3 )

dr = −
  

r ( r − m(r) )

	

Fig.	9	–	Pressure	inside	a	neutron	star	
as	a	function	of	its	radius	(TOV	model).	

It	can	be	seen	that	the	pressure	at	the	center	of	the	star	tends	towards	infinity	
when	 Rn	=	0.9428	Rs	thus	before	the	radius	of	the	star	reaches	the	
Schwarzschild	radius.	

	
9	
The	solution	for	values	greater	than	this	critical	radius	is	shown	in	Figure	10.	
Although	the	TOV	solution	is	steady-state	and	assumes	a	spherical	
symmetry,	thus	represents	only	an	approximation,	it	denotes	the	extreme	
fast	growth	rate	of	the	singularity	(p	=	∞)	that	comes	into	being	at	the	center	
of	the	star,	the	more	the	Schwarzschild	radius	is	approached:	

	
Fig.	10	–	Pressure	soaring	quickly	in	the	neutron	star	
for	values	greater	than	the	critical	value.	

Those	who	build	black	hole	theoretical	models	start	from	the	hypothesis	in	
which	the	star	would	shrink	asymptotically	down	to	the	Schwarzschild	radius.	
The	following	curve	shows	how	this	situation	is	achieved.	Along	abscissa	is	
the	radius	of	the	star	 Rn.	The	parabola	represents	the	evolution	of	the	
Schwarzschild	radius	Rs	which	increases	according	to	the	mass	of	the	star,	
hence,	for	a	constant	density,	as	the	radius	of	the	star	cubed.

!	is	the	critical	star	radius	when	Rn	=	Rs	(geometric	criticality).	

We	observe	a	horizontal	line,	directly	derived	from	the	Schwarzschild	
solution	of	February	1916,	which	marks	the	limit	of	criticality	of	the	inner	
metric.	
Below	this	critical	situation,	the	neutron	star	is	like	this:		

	

Fig.	12	

We	see	that	its	Schwarzschild	radius	Rs	is	located	inside	the	star,	whereas	the	
radius   ˆR,	which	marks	the	criticality	of	the	external	solution,	lies	outside.	
Thus	the	two	solutions,	connected	outside	this	geometric	criticality,	are	
singularity-free.	
Theorists	completely	obscure	the	physical	criticality,	i.e.	the	tremendous	
rises	of	pressure	and	speed	of	light	to	infinity	in	the	center	of	the	star,	which	
take	place	before	the	situation	of	geometric	criticality	occurs.	This	should	not	
leave	the	physicist	unmoved,	as	a	pressure	is	also	an	energy	density.

Reconsideration	of	the	problem	according	to	the	Janus	model	
The	Schwarzschild	exterior	and	interior	solutions	are	also	solutions	of	the	
Janus	cosmological	model,	[5]	[6]	[7]	a	bimetric	description	of	the	universe	
as	an	 M4	manifold	associated	to	two	conjugated	Riemannian	metrics,	
generating	their	own	set	of	geodesics,	solutions	of	two	coupled	field	
equations:	

!"#$ −12!$("#$ =* 	,"#$ + (.($,"#.	 !
!"#. −12!.("#. =−* 	 ($(.,"#$ +,"#. 	
Let's	start	with	the	Schwarzschild	exterior	solution,	with	no	right	hand-side.	
It	is	known	that	in	the	Schwarzschild	solution,	the	quantity	α	is	just	a	simple	
integration	constant,	which	can	be	taken	positive	or	negative.		
In	the	following,	a	local	situation	is	arbitrarily	considered,	where	  g(+) = g(−).	
Let	us	assume	that	the	length	Rs,	the	Schwarzschild	radius,	is	strictly	positive	
and	that	α,	simple	integration	constant,	can	have	equal	and	opposite	values.	
Thus	we	have	two	coupled	solutions	outside	the	star.	Let's	write	these	
metrics:		
Let's	call	them	"posi-Schwarzschild	exterior"	and	"nega-Schwarzschild	
exterior".	They	are	written,	choosing	Schwarzschild's	auxiliary	quantity	R	or	
"Hilbert's	variable":

What	happens,	according	to	the	Janus	model,	when	the	mass	of	a	subcritical	
neutron	star	is	gradually	increased	to	the	point	where	the	physical	criticality	
is	reached	at	its	center?	As	we	will	see	in	the	next	section,	this	kind	of	event	
should	be	quite	common	in	the	cosmos.	
It	must	be	said	that	without	a	complete	time-dependent	analytic	solution	that	
could	be	based	on	a	previous	work,	we	will	give	this	article	a	somewhat	
conjectural	character.		
But	in	this	day	and	age	of	evaporating	black	holes	fitted	with	firewalls	
protecting	them	from	the	information	paradox,	we	think	we	can	grant	
ourselves	this	right.	
First	and	foremost,	we	present	the	"soft"	scenario,	where	such	a	physical	
criticality	is	slowly	approached.		
As	already	mentioned	in	the	first	part	of	this	paper,	binary	systems	are	very	
abundant	in	the	universe.	For	a	number	of	them,	a	member	of	the	couple	has	
become	a	neutron	star	after	the	gravitational	collapse	of	a	supernova.

Leaking	Neutron	Star

In	this	particular	case,	this	neutron	star	is	stable,	subcritical.	Then	its	donor	
companion	star	sends	a	continuous	flow	of	matter	in	the	form	of	stellar	wind,	
accreted	gravitationally	by	the	neutron	star,	whose	mass	is	therefore	
gradually	increased.	
The	rise	of	the	energy	density	at	the	center	of	the	star	eventually	produces	
there	a	mass	inversion	process.	Indeed,	according	to	the	Janus	cosmological	
model,	all	physical	constants	underwent	a	joint	variation	during	the	high	
energy	density	state	of	the	radiation-dominated	era,	right	after	the	Big	Bang	
where	c,	for	example,	reached	an	infinite	value.	[6]	We	think	some	events	
involving	very	high	energy	densities,	as	in	the	center	of	critical	neutron	stars,	
can	similarly	recreate	conditions	allowing	a	"bridge"	to	briefly	appear,	
joining	the	positive	and	negative	sectors	together,	though	which	mass	can	be	
exchanged	and	inverted.	[11]	
As	this	mass	in	excess,	which	has	become	negative	according	to	the	Janus	
model,	no	longer	interacts	with	the	positive	mass	except	through	
antigravitation,	it	is	repelled	by	the	star	and	dispersed	away	in	space	among	
the	interstellar	medium,	then	the	intergalactic	medium	where	it	ends	up.		
An	analogy	can	be	made,	comparing	this	process	with	the	"bung	&	float"	
mechanism	keeping	the	water	level	constant	in	a	flush	tank:	
	

	

Fig.	13	

	

	

	
14	
When	an	input	of	matter	in	excess	triggers	the	beginning	of	a	criticality	in	the	
center	of	the	star,	"the	bung	is	raised"	and	the	"plughole"	opens:	

The	plughole,	quite	small	in	diameter,	quickly	closes	as	soon	as	the	star	has	
become	subcritical	again,	and	the	situation	becomes:	

Fig.	14	

Fig.	15	

	

	

	
15	
When	a	model	is	proposed,	is	must	describe	a	possible	observation	able	to	
falsify	it.	In	this	case,	it	is	a	non-observation:	we	conjecture	that	stellar	black	
holes	do	not	exist	and	that	the	observed	effects	are	only	caused	by	subcritical	
neutron	stars,	which	are	abundant.		
The	geometry	describing	these	objects	is	then	represented	by	the	four	
metrics	given	above,	a	borderline	situation	at	the	edge	of	criticality,	which	
corresponds,	in	Schwarzschild's	second	paper,	to:		
cos	χa		slightly	superior	to	1/3	
We	can	then	give	a	name	to	such	kind	of	neutron	stars	near	criticality,	
smoothly	evacuating	any	input	of	matter	in	excess	by	the	inversion	of	some	
of	its	mass	at	its	center:		
A	more	faithful	image	would	be	to	shape	the	flush	tank	as	a	bowl,	
corresponding	to	the	gravitational	potential	in	the	neutron	star.	As	long	as	
the	criticality	is	not	reached,	we	are	in	the	situation	of	Fig.	16	on	the	left.	
When	the	critical	mass	is	reached,	the	bung	is	raised.	The	matter	in	excess,	
whose	mass	is	reversed,	is	poured	out.	It	follows	the	relief	of	a	promontory	
which	is	the	mirror	image	of	the	bowl	(the	gravitational	potential	is	reversed	
after	its	passage	in	this	sector).	This,	until	the	level	drops	under	criticality,	
causing	the	bung	to	close.

A	"hard"	scenario	corresponds	to	the	fusion	of	two	subcritical	neutron	stars	
into	a	single	object.	Let	us	call	 M1	and	 M2	the	masses	of	these	two	stars.		
If	 M1	+	M2	<	2.5	solar	masses,	this	fusion	will	take	place	without	mass	
inversion.	But	if	the	sum	exceeds	this	value,	the	mass	in	excess	m	will	be	
inverted	and	repelled	from	the	resulting	star,	which	will	become	subcritical	
again.	Let	us	call	this	sum:	M1	+	M2	+	m.		
The	inversion	and	expulsion	of	this	excess	of	mass	m,	brief	and	brutal,	must	
be	accompanied	by	a	powerful	emission	of	gravitational	waves.	This	is	our	
interpretation	of	the	recent	evidence	at	LIGO	[10]	and	not	as	a	fusion	of	two	
black	holes	about	thirty	solar	masses.	Values	producing	a	gravitational	signal	
with	an	energy	equivalent	to	only	3	solar	masses	allow	such	an	identification	
in	spite	of	a	tiny	signal-to-noise	ratio.	
We	will	then	seek	to	describe	this	process	building	a	steady	state	solution.	
Already,	the	high	sensitivity	of	the	solution	when	approaching	criticality	
evokes	the	rapid	expansion	of	a	central	devouring	singularity,	reminiscent	of	
the	ancient	video	game	Pac-Man,	then	its	closing	just	as	fast.

neutron	stars.	The	total	inverted	mass	then	approaches	2.5	solar	masses.	
Once	the	mass	inversion	process	has	been	completed,	how	could	such	a	
situation	be	described,	geometrically?		
This	situation	is	not	simple.	In	this	type	of	scenario,	and	in	certain	cases,	a	
configuration	can	be	considered	with	the	system	of	equations		
(+) = 0		
(−) = 0	
which	would	represent	a	kind	of	"instantaneous	photography"	where	the	
mass	density	is	not	zero	locally,	but	the	sum	of	the	two	mass-energy	
densities,	positive	and	negative,	is	equal	to	zero.	In	reference	[11]	this	type	
of	solution	was	studied,	through	joint	steady	state	metric	solutions.	Although	
this	is	not	perfectly	rigorous	yet,	it	can	still	give	a	general	idea.	This	is	an	open	
and	exciting	question	that	we	are	currently	working	on.	
Such	a	solution	was	described	in	2015.	[11]	When	the	system	of	the	four	
metric	solutions	of	the	Janus	model	is	considered,	it	should	be	noted	that	one	
can	opt	for	a	solution	where	the	transferred	mass,	which	has	become	
negative,	is	now	located	in	the	negative	sector.	
This	configuration	would	then	be:

Compared	to	the	configuration	where	the	mass	is	positive,	there	is	a	
complete	exchange	of	the	two	geodesic	systems.	By	the	way	it	can	be	noted	
that	this	system	of	four	metrics	describes	the	geometry	in	the	vicinity	of	
negative	mass	conglomerates	located	at	the	center	of	the	giant	voids	of	the	
large-scale	structure	of	the	universe,	as	foreseen	by	the	Janus	model.	This	
configuration	generates	negative	gravitational	lensing	on	positive	energy	
photons,	a	phenomenon	initially	described	by	the	author	in	1995.	[12]	In	this	
model,	a	gravitational	lens	effect	reduces	the	apparent	magnitude	of	high-
redshift	galaxies	(z	>	7)	which	makes	them	appear	as	dwarfs.		
As	suggested	by	a	Japanese	team,	[13]	and	in	the	video	"JANUS	#20"	
presenting	these	concepts,	[14]	mapping	the	universe	using	negative	weak	
gravitational	lensing	could	falsify	this	model	of	lacunar	large-scale	structure	
of	the	universe,	with	galaxy	filaments,	clusters	and	superclusters	around	
large	void	bubbles.	[15]	
But	this	neutron	star	model	remains,	as	it	is,	schematic	and	embryonic.	It	is	
known	that	such	objects	are	rotating	fast,	which	is	not	currently	taken	into	
account.	The	external	metric	should	therefore	be	that	of	Kerr,	[16]	and	not	
that	of	Schwarzschild,	and	the	corresponding	internal	metric	remains	to	be	
made.	
Moreover,	the	magnetic	field	associated	with	neutron	stars	is	very	intense:	
typically	108	teslas,	to	more	than	1011	teslas	for	most	extreme	cases	
(magnetars).	It	results	from	the	compression	of	magnetic	field	lines	that	
preexisted	in	the	massive	star,	before	its	gravitational	collapse	in	the	
supernova	phenomenon.	This	magnetic	field	probably	plays	an	important	
role,	likely	to	influence	the	proposed	scenario,	in	particular	on	the	structure	
of	possible	negative	mass	remnants	resulting	from	the	violent	fusion	and	
mass	inversion	of	a	pair	of	neutron	stars.	
Nevertheless,	a	study	carried	out	on	the	basis	of	the	Schwarzschild	metric	
enables	the	identification	of	general	ideas.	
		
This	approach	modifies	the	idea	commonly	followed	in	the	field	of	
differential	geometry	and	manifold	theory.	Remember	that	these	theories	
were	born	from	concerns	about	how	to	map	Earth,	which	is	a	sphere.	
However,	in	order	to	map	it,	only	plane	paper	sheets	are	available.	
Cartographers	therefore	use	atlases	made	up	of	flat	maps,	supplied	with	
indications	allowing	to	connect	them	two	by	two.		

A	change	of	topology	

	
19	
Modern	geometry	has	attempted	to	generalize	this	idea.	But	imagine	a	planet	
where	planar	surfaces,	in	particular	paper	as	a	map	support,	are	unknown.	
Conversely,	there	is	in	this	world	a	profusion	of	tree	leaves	shaped	as	
spherical	caps,	stackable	one	onto	the	others.	Cartographers	of	this	planet	
could	then	constitute	an	atlas	made	of	sets	of	maps	traced	onto	curved	sheets.		
Differential	geometry	has	made	widespread	use	of	the	set	"atlas	+	maps"	
which	allows	to	shape	those	maps	onto	any	support,	as	long	as	rules	are	
provided	to	connect	them	to	each	other.		
In	such	a	perspective,	the	approach	represents:	
-  The	choice	of	a	manifold	Mn.	
- 
Its	arbitrary	association	to	a	topology.	
-  The	addition	of	maps	constituting	an	atlas.		
When	 he	 builds	 his	 solution,	 Schwarzschild	 opts	
implicitly	
for	 a	
representation	space	   !3 × !.	He	intends	to	describe	his	hypersurface-
solution	in	such	a	space.	He	then	obtains	a	metric	that	evokes	a	non-
contractible	object,	that	may	be	taken	for	a	manifold	with	boundary.		
Hilbert,	giving	to	time	the	nature	of	a	pure	imaginary	quantity,2		implicitly	
situates	the	solution	in	a	space	  !3 × ".		
The	analytic	extensions	developed	later,	like	that	of	Kruskal,	[17]	belong	to	
the	same	choice,	to	the	same	idea.	This	is	what	will	make	the	Argentinian-
American	physicist	Juan	Martín	Maldacena	say:3	
— Kruskal	extended	the	solution	to	cover	the	full	spacetime.	
Specifically,	he	should	have	said:	
— Kruskal	extended	the	solution	to	cover	his	views	of	the	spacetime.	
In	doing	so,	he	builds	this	extension	using	several	connected	metrics.

An	important	question	arises:		
— What	is	the	information	contained	in	a	solution	to	the	field	equation,	
expressed	in	the	form	of	a	metric?	Would	such	a	solution	contain		
its	own	topology?		
Said	otherwise:	
— Should	the	expression	of	this	solution,	in	the	form	of	a	hypersurface,	be	
limited	to	representations	where	the	element	of	length	remains	real?	
The	Einstein	field	equations,	whose	metric	is	derived,	involves	only	real	
quantities.	The	components	of	the	Ricci	tensor	are	real,	its	derivatives	are	
real.	How,	under	these	conditions,	to	consider	expressing	the	solution	by	
implementing	pure	imaginary	quantities?		
If	we	stick	to	the	real	world,	this	means	that	when	we	explore	parts	of	the	
(numerical)	space	related	to	variables,	and	come	across	an	element	of	pure	
imaginary	length,	or	when	the	signature	of	the	metric	becomes	altered,	
which	is	the	same	thing,	one	is	then	simply	outside	the	hypersurface.	
This	can	be	illustrated	with	the	Schwarzschild	solution.	It	is	then	enough	to	
start	from	"Hilbert's	representation"	with	the	auxiliary	variable	R:	
− R2( dθ2 + sin2θdϕ2 )	
and	use	the	change	of	space	variable	as	shown	in	ref.	[11]:		
The	metric	is	then	written:		
⎥	
This	metric	is	regular	for	any	value	of	this	new	space	variable	ρ	including	
the	vicinity	of	 ρ= 0	equivalent	to	 R = Rs	with	  Log chρ= 0.	
To	get	convinced,	just	make	series	expansion	of	functions	 Log chρand	  th2ρ	in	
the	neighborhood	of	 ρ= 0	to	find	their	ratio	tends	to	2.

What	is	the	topology	of	this	four-dimensional	hypersurface?	We	can	focus	on	
its	spatial	part:		
This	geometric	object	is	not	contractible.	If	we	fix	the	quantity	ρ	we	obtain	
an	object	defined	by	the	metric:		
By	setting	the	variable	 θ,	for	example	to	the	value	  θ= π/ 2,	we	get	a	
maximum	value	for	the	perimeter:		
By	varying	it,	we	obtain	a	family	of	2-spheres	that	are	parallel,	one-parameter	
closed	surfaces	 Σ2(ρ)	having	a	minimum	area	  A = 4πRs
2.		
The	closed	surface	of	minimal	area	 Σ2(0)	acts	like	a	throat	surface.4		
gtt	of	the	metric	is	zero	when	 ρ= 0,	which	leads	to	the	nullity	of	
But	the	term	 
the	determinant	of	the	metric	at	this	point,	and	the	impossibility	of	defining	
a	system	of	Gaussian	coordinates	along	this	closed	surface	 Σ2,	in	other	words	
it	is	impossible	to	orientate	time	and	space.		
The	geometric	object	emerging	from	the	Schwarzschild	solution	is	therefore	
not	a	manifold	in	the	classical	sense	of	the	term,	but	an	orbifold	containing	a	
singular	region	 Σ2(0)	where	the	object	is	locally	non-orientable.	This	is	not	a	
sphere,	but	a	projective	P2.	It	was	already	difficult	to	create	the	mental	image	
of	two	three-dimensional	spaces	connected	by	a	throat	sphere.	One	imagines	
the	mental	efforts	that	must	be	deployed	if	this	throat	surface	becomes	Boy's	
surface…	
Such	a	structure	then	fits	with	the	Janus	model.	Indeed,	time	reversal	
according	to	the	dynamical	group	theory,	[18]	is	actually	the	inversion	of	
energy,	hence	the	inversion	of	mass.5	Therefore,	the	object	represents	some	
kind	of	space	bridge	connecting	two	PT-symmetric	Minkowski	spaces.

About	the	time	of	free	fall	

	
22	
Classically,	events	occurring	near	a	black	hole	are	theoretically	seen	as	
"frozen	in	time"	for	a	distant	observer.	Indeed,	when	the	time	of	free	fall	is	
calculated	with	the	variable	t,	which	is	supposed	to	be	the	time	experienced	
by	the	distant	observer,	and	is	compared	to	the	proper	time	 s	of	the	test	
particle	falling	onto	the	black	hole,	which	is	the	only	one	intrinsically	related	
to	the	geometric	object,	one	finds	the	this:	[9]		

	

Fig.	17	–	Fall	toward	the	origin	of	a	Schwarzschild	geometry	
in	terms	of	coordinate	time	t	and	proper	time	on	the	test	particle	s/c.	

This	choice	of	time	marker	t	seems	necessary.	Yet	we	must	bear	in	mind	that	
the	choice	of	variables	with	respect	to	the	description	of	the	hypersurface-
solution,	where	the	only	intrinsic	quantity	is	s,	remains	an	arbitrary	choice	
representing	the	physical	interpretation	of	the	solution.		
We	then	refer	to	the	Kerr	metric	according	to	the	formulation	given	by	Boyer	
and	Lindquist.	[19]	We	will	replace	their	space	variable	 ρ	with	the	same	
Greek	letter	Ρ	in	uppercase,	to	avoid	any	confusion	with	the	other	change	of	
variable	used	above.

What	differentiates	this	writing	of	the	Kerr	metric	solution	from	the	classical	
expression	of	the	Schwarzschild	metric?	The	presence	of	a	cross	term	 dϕdt.	
Photons	follow	null	geodesics.	Considering	azimuthal	geodesics	at	 Ρ = Cst,	
two	different	values	of	the	speed	of	light	are	obtained.	Similarly,	if	we	
calculate	the	period	of	rotation	of	test	particles	along	circular	geodesics,	we	
will	get	two	different	values,	depending	on	whether	we	travel	these	
geodesics	clockwise	or	counterclockwise.		
This	is	classically	interpreted	as	rotational	frame-dragging	or	Lense-Thirring	
effect.	In	[9]	we	read:6	
This	situation	is	inherently	related	to	the	Kerr	solution.	We	can	wonder,	
always	in	the	sense	of	Ernst	Mach,	if	this	strong	inertial	dragging	of	the	
reference	frame	within	the	ergosphere	may	represent	a	phenomenon	
automatically	linked	to	such	extreme	situations,	so	this	has	to	be	necessarily	
taken	into	account.	
But	how	to	introduce	a	radial	frame-dragging?	Thanks	to	the	change	of	time	
variable	suggested	by	Sir	Arthur	Eddington	in	1924:	[20]		
Such	a	change	of	temporal	variable	can	be	applied	either	to	the	
Schwarzschild	metric	or	to	the	Kerr	metric.	Let's	choose	here	to	make	this	
change	in	the	Schwarzschild	metric,	written	in	the	coordinate	system	
  ( t , R ,θ,ϕ).		
																																																								
6	Ref.	[9]	Chapitre	7	–	The	Kerr	Solution,	page	258.	

Loosely speaking, we may think of the rotating source as "dragging" 
space around with it; in a Machian sense the source "competes" with 
Lorentzian boundary conditions at the infinity in the establishment of a 
local inertial frame.

Trajectories	of	test	particles	along	timelike	geodesics	can	be	calculated:	

	
But	the	calculation	of	the	free	fall	time	provides	a	different	result	depending	
on	whether	it	is	a	centripetal	radial	trajectory	 (ν= + 1)	or	a	centrifugal	one

When	the	parameter	λ	is	equal	to	unity,	this	corresponds	to	a	particle	with

conditions.	Let's	consider	a	radial	trajectory	in	a	situation	corresponding	to	
the	vicinity	of	the	surface	R	=	Rs	:		
• In	a	plunging	trajectory	 (ν= − 1)	the	free	fall	time	is	finite.		
• In	an	escape	trajectory	 (ν= 1)	it	becomes	infinite.

When	the	test	particle	crosses	the	throat	surface,	time	reverses.	If	we	still	
consider	this	motion,	as	it	would	be	perceived	by	a	distant	observer	made	of	
positive	mass,7	the	cross	term	is	now	opposite	and	the	metric	is	written:

Opposite	situation	too	for	radial	trajectories:

Conversely	this	time,	escape	trajectories	take	place	over	a	finite	time,	while

It	should	be	noticed	that	the	opposite	sign	of	the	cross	term	in	the	metric	
leads	to	an	ephemeral	white	hole	model	in	the	negative	sector,	i.e.	there,	the	
throat	surface	still	behaves	like	a	one-way	membrane,	but	in	the	other	
direction.

Conclusion		

	
26	
This	black	hole	chimera	is	a	house	of	cards	and	it	tumbled	down.	The	"freeze-
frame"	is	a	consequence	of	an	arbitrary	choice	of	the	temporal	variable	while	
at	the	same	time	neglecting	the	frame-dragging	phenomenon.	In	his	opening	
lecture,	at	the	Karl	Schwarzschild	Meeting	in	Frankfurt	(the	city	where	he	
was	born)	in	July	2017,8	Maldacena	said:		
— The Schwarzschild solution has confused us over a hundred years and 

it has forced us to sharpen our views on space and time. It has lead to 
sharper  understanding  of  Einstein’s  theory.  Experimentally,  it  is 
explaining  several  astrophysical  observations.  Its  quantum  aspects 
have been a source of theoretical paradoxes that are forcing us to 
understand  better  the  relation  between  spacetime,  geometry  and 
quantum mechanics. 

On	the	contrary,	I	believe	that	this	alleged	deepening	of	the	conception	of	
spacetime	has	led	cosmologists	to	depart	from	the	original	vision	of	men	like	
Einstein	and	Schwarzschild,	who	had	a	very	profound	intuition	of	geometry	
and	physical	phenomena.	By	choosing	to	extend	spacetime	to	a	phantasmal	
element,	they	built	an	object	they	called	a	black	hole,	endowed	with	a	strange	
"interior"	in	which,	in	the	words	of	specialists	"time	and	space	are	
interchanged	one	another".		
Formerly,	the	late	French	cosmologist	Jean	Heidmann	used	to	say:	
Jadis	le	cosmologiste	français	feu	Jean	Heidmann	avait	coutume	de	dire	:		
— When	 talking	 about	 black	 holes,	 common	 sense	 has	 to	 be	 left	 in	 the	
Such	an	attitude	has	led	scientists	to	dissert	for	half	a	century	on	properties	
of	a	central	singularity	that	exists	only	in	their	imagination,	in	the	
mathematical	definition	of	the	term.		
The	theoretical	phantasmagoria	that	preceded	the	elaboration	of	such	
theories	ensues	from	the	lack	of	in-depth	reading	of	Schwarzschild's	second	
paper	[2]	published	in	February	1916	(admittedly	untranslated	for	83	
years!)	where	everything	was	already	put	in	place,	summed	up	in	the	Fig.	7	
that	we	reproduce	again	below.

That	is	to	say:	

Fig.	7	

At the center of the sphere (χ = 0) velocity of light and pressure 
become infinite when cos χa = 1/3, and the fall velocity becomes 8/9 of the 
(naturally  measured)  velocity  of  light.  Hence  there  is  a  limit  to  the 
concentration, above which a sphere of incompressible fluid can not exist. 
If one would apply our equations to values cosχa < 1/3, one would get 
discontinuities already outside the center of the sphere. 

Nature	has	more	common	sense	than	one	imagines,	and	arranges	to	give

The	black	hole	has	become	the	deus	ex	machina	of	modern	times.	Computer-

As for quantum gravity, it remains an unachieved discipline, insofar as 
gravitation has never been quantified. Discoursing on its ins and outs is 
tantamount to speculating on the outcome of a marriage that has never been 
consummated. 
Theoretical astrophysics must produce models that are likely to be 
confronted with observations, to be falsified in the sense of Karl Popper. The 
model we propose leads to the conclusion that the mass of neutron stars is 
automatically limited below the critical value of 2.5 solar masses, through a 
mechanism removing any excess of matter via partial mass inversion. The 
lack of any observation of X-ray emitting objects with a higher mass also 
militates in favor of this model. The fusion of two subcritical neutron stars 
could finally explain the observation of gravitational waves, the energy 
involved corresponding to the mass inversion of the matter in excess, of up 
to several solar masses.  
We predict that stellar black holes will never be observed, simply because 
they exist only in the imagination of their creators. 
We also conjecture that the energy source of quasars in active galaxy nuclei 
does not rely on black holes and that "supermassive black holes" located in 
the center of galaxies are very massive relics of such quasars. Work in 
progress on this subject, that will be presented at a later stage.
