Abstract

Assuming SO(3)-spherical symmetry, the 4–dimensional Einstein

equation reduces to an equation conformally related to the ﬁeld equa-

tion for 2–dimensional gravity following from the Lagrangian L =
|R|1/3.

Solutions for 2–dimensional gravity always possess a local isometry

because the traceless part of its Ricci tensor identically vanishes.

Combining both facts, we get a new proof of Birkhoﬀ’s theorem;

contrary to other proofs, no coordinates must be introduced.

The SO(m)-spherically symmetric solutions of the (m + 1)–dimen-
sional Einstein equation can be found by considering L = |R|1/m
in two dimensions. This yields several generalizations of Birkhoﬀ’s

theorem in an arbitrary number of dimensions, and to an arbitrary

signature of the metric.

1 Introduction

The Birkhoﬀ theorem states that every spherically symmetric vacuum solu-

tion of Einstein’s general relativity theory is part of the Schwarzschild so-

lution; therefore, the solution possesses a four-dimensional1 isometry group,

at least locally. This theorem has been generalized into several directions,

e.g. to Einstein–Maxwell ﬁelds and to higher dimensions by Bronnikov, Ko-

valchuk and Melnikov in [1].

In the meanwhile it is generally known that the popular formulation “ev-

ery spherically symmetric vacuum solution is static” is misleading, because

inside the horizon, the Schwarzschild black hole is not static. Now, Bondi

and Rindler [2] argued, that even in the absence of a horizon, the use of the

word “static” might be misleading, too.

Both Schmutzer and Goenner [3] cite refs. [4] for the original Birkhoﬀ the-

orem, the historic development can be summarized as follows: “Jebsen (1921)

was the ﬁrst to formulate it and Birkhoﬀ (1923) was the ﬁrst to prove it”.

Hawking, Ellis [5, page 369] gave a proof of it based on B. Schmidt’s method

[6]. A further proof is given in sct. 32.2 of Misner, Thorne and Wheeler [7].

They relate this theorem to the fact that no monopole gravitational waves ex-

ist in Einstein’s theory. The Birkhoﬀ theorem in 2–dimensional pure metric

gravity has been deduced in [8] and generalized in [9]. It possesses analogous

formulations for 2-dimensional dilaton–gravity theories, cf. refs. [10 - 14] for

its recent development.

In ref. [15], Ashtekar, Bicak and B. Schmidt considered those solutions of

the 4–dimensional Einstein equation which possess one translational Killing

ﬁeld. The non-trivial solutions fail to be asymptotically ﬂat; to get nev-

ertheless a sensible notion of energy it turned out to be advantageous to

reformulate the problem as 3–dimensional gravity with additional matter.

1This is the remarkable part of that theorem, because the rotation group SO(3) is only

3–dimensional.

2

At the same formal level, but with another scope as in [15], Romero,

Tavakol and Zalaletdinov [16] reduced the dimension from 5 to 4. One of

their results read: 4–dimensional gravity with matter can be isometrically

embedded into a 5–dimensional Ricci–ﬂat space–time, i.e., into a vacuum

solution of the 5–dimensional Einstein equation.

In the present paper, we follow a similar line as in [15] and [16] and deduce

Birkhoﬀ–type theorems for warped products of manifolds where one of them

is two–dimensional. (Here we use the notion “Birkhoﬀ–type theorem” for any

theorem stating that under certain circumstances the gravitational vacuum

solution has more symmetries than the inserted metric ansatz.) The proof

is done in two steps: First, the D–dimensional Einstein equation will be

reduced to two–dimensional gravity. Second: By applying the fact that the

traceless part of the Ricci tensor identically vanishes in two dimensions, we

always get an additional Killing vector.

As a byproduct, we present a new and coordinate–free proof of the clas-

sical Birkhoﬀ theorem.

The paper is organized as follows: In sct. 2 the warped products are

introduced, in sct. 3 the necessary conformal transformation is explained,

and in sct. 4 the new direct proof of the Birkhoﬀ theorem is given by an

explicit deﬁnition of the additional Killing vector. Sct. 5 shows the detailed

relation to several 2-dimensional theories, and sct. 6 gives the summary.

2 Warped products

Let us consider a D-dimensional Riemannian manifold of arbitrary signature

and metric ds2 of the form

ds2 = gαβdxαdxβ = dσ2 + e2U d ˆΩ2

where

is a two-dimensional manifold and

dσ2 = gijdxidxj

d ˆΩ2 = ˆgABdxAdxB

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

is n–dimensional with n ≥ 1. Hence, D = n + 2 ≥ 3. The indices i, j take
the values 0, 1; the indices A, B take the values 2, . . . , n + 1; and the indices

α, β cover both of them, i.e., values 0, . . . , n + 1.

We assume that ˆgAB depends on the xA only, and both U and gij depend
on the xi only. So we have deﬁned ds2 to be the warped product between dσ2
and d ˆΩ2 with warping function e2U . The purpose of the whole consid-
eration is to show the following: If ds2 is a D-dimensional Einstein
space and the dimension of the isometry group of d ˆΩ2 equals k,
then ds2 possesses a k + 1–dimensional isometry group, at least lo-
cally. Taking d ˆΩ2 as standard two–sphere, we recover the original Birkhoﬀ

theorem.

The method we want to apply for proving this is ﬁrst to reformulate

the D-dimensional Einstein equation for ds2 as a ﬁeld equation in the 2-

dimensional space dσ2, and second to apply known results [8, 9] from scale–

invariant gravity in 2 dimensions.

4

3 A conformal transformation

To simplify the calculation of the Ricci tensor of ds2, we perform a conformal

transformation in D dimensions as follows:

dˆs2 = ˆgαβdxαdxβ = e−2U ds2

Using eq. (2.1) this implies

where the analogous conformal transformation in 2 dimensions reads

dˆs2 = dˆσ2 + d ˆΩ2

dˆσ2 = e−2U dσ2

gαβ = e2U ˆgαβ

By construction,

and

ˆgiA = 0

ˆgij,A = 0

ˆgAB,i = 0

We denote the D–dimensional Ricci tensor for ds2 by (D)Rαβ, and the 2–
dimensional Ricci tensor for dσ2 by Rij. For the hatted quantities, we need

not the distinguishing presuperscript because by eqs. (3.2), (3.5), the Ricci
tensor ˆRij for dˆσ2 and the Ricci tensor ˆRAB for d ˆΩ2 together form the Ricci
tensor ˆRαβ for dˆs2. The latter fulﬁls ˆRAi = 0 because dˆs2 represents a direct
product.

The Ricci scalars are denoted as follows:

(D)R for ds2; R for dσ2; (D) ˆR
for dˆs2; ˆR for dˆσ2; and (n) ˆR for d ˆΩ2. Applying that dˆs2 is a direct product

we get

The assumption that ds2 is an Einstein space reads

(D) ˆR = ˆR + (n) ˆR

(D)Rαβ = Λ gαβ

is the metric for dˆσ2. Then for the Ricci tensors the following relation holds:

ˆgij = e−2U gij

ˆRij = Rij + gij 2U

ˆR = (R + 22U) e2U

ˆ2U = e2U 2U

i.e.

we get

The conformal invariance of the 2-dimensional D’Alembertian implies

therefore, eq. (3.10) can be rewritten as

R = ( ˆR − 2ˆ2U) e−2U

Now, we turn to the D-dimensional conformal transformation eq. (3.4),

(D)Rαβ = ˆRαβ − n[Uˆ;αβ − U;αU;β] − ˆgαβ[ˆ2U + nU;γUˆ;γ]

(3.13)

where the “ˆ;” denotes the covariant derivative made with ˆgαβ and

First we insert eq. (3.7) into eq. (3.13) and consider the AB-part of it only.

We get after some algebra

ˆRAB = ˆΛ ˆgAB

(3.14)

U ˆ; γ = ˆg γ µ U; µ

6

where we have applied the abbreviation

ˆΛ = Λe2U + ˆ2U + n U;γ Uˆ;γ

(3.15)

By construction, ˆRAB and ˆgAB depend on the xA only, whereas ˆΛ depends
on the xi only. Consequently, ˆΛ must be a constant. Remark: For n ≥ 3,
this statement follows already from the structure of eq. (3.14). For n = 2,

however, it is not obvious from the beginning. Eq. (3.14) expresses the fact
that d ˆΩ2 must be a n–dimensional Einstein space.

Transvecting eq. (3.14) with ˆgAB we get

(n) ˆR = n ˆΛ

(3.16)

In the next step, we consider the i, j–part of eq. (3.13). We get

Λgij = ˆRij − n[Uˆ;ij − U;iU;j] − ˆgij[ˆ2U + nU;mUˆ;m]

(3.17)

Transvecting eq. (3.17) with ˆgij we get

2 Λ e2U = ˆR − D ˆ2 U − n U;i Uˆ;i

(3.18)

We apply eqs. (3.10), (3.11) and use the notation

U , i = g i j U, j

Then we get

part of the tensor

has to vanish.

R = 2 Λ + n ( 2 U + U,i U ,i )

(3.19)

The remaining of eq. (3.17) consists in the requirement that the traceless

ˆHij = Uˆ;ij − U;iU;j

(3.20)

7

4 The 2-dimensional picture (direct way)

In this section, we consider gravity in two dimensions in the two conformally

related frames dσ2 and dˆσ2, and the additional scalar ﬁeld U. The essential

equations are (3.15), (3.18) and (3.20): They represent the ﬁeld equations in

the hatted frame. To get the equations in the unhatted frame we use eqs.

(3.3) and (3.8). As a result, we have to replace (3.18) by (3.19), (3.15) by

the equation

Λ = ˆΛe−2U − 2U − n U,i U ,i

The tracelessness of the term (3.20) will be transformed to the condition that

(4.1)

(4.2)

is traceless. One can rewrite eq. (4.2) as

Hij = U;ij + U;iU;j

Hij = e−U ( eU );ij

so that the condition is equivalent to say that the traceless part of ( eU );ij

must vanish.

At this point we are able to apply appendix B of ref. [8], where eU now

plays the role of G eq. (B2) of [8].

First case2 : Let U be constant in any region of space. By eq. (4.1) this
case appears only if Λ and ˆΛ have the same sign. Eq. (3.19) then implies
R = 2Λ. Consequently, dσ2 represents a 2–surface of constant curvature, and

the warped product eq. (2.1) specializes to a direct product. So we get for
this ﬁrst case: If the dimension of the isometry group of d ˆΩ2 equals k, then
ds2 possesses a k + 3–dimensional isometry group, at least locally.

Second case: Let U ; i 6= 0 in any region of space. We choose an orientable
subregion W of it and ﬁx an orientation there. Then we are allowed to

symmetric metric

8

use the covariantly constant antisymmetric pseudotensor ǫij within W . It is

completely deﬁned by ﬁxing the component

Indices will be shifted with the metric gij, and then we deﬁne

ǫ01 = q| det gij|

ξi = ǫij ( eU );j

(4.3)

which is a nowhere vanishing vector ﬁeld in the region W .

[In index–free

notation this can be written as

curl(eU ) which is analogous to the rot-

operator in three dimensions.] Let us calculate its covariant derivative.

ξi;k = ǫij ( eU );j
;k

Because of eq. (4.2) ( eU );j

;k is c times the Kronecker tensor. Therefore, we

get

ξi;k = ǫij c δj

k = c ǫik

(4.4)

The antisymmetry of the ǫ–pseudotensor proves ξi to be a Killing vector in
dσ2.

But, in contrast to the ﬁrst case, here it is not immediately clear that an

isometry of dσ2 represents an isometry of ds2.

space. Then by sct. V A of ref.

Subcase 2.1.: Let ξi be a non–vanishing light-like vector in any region of
[8] dσ2 is ﬂat and of signature (+−). It
turns out that one of its Killing vectors (not necessarily ξi itself) represents
also a Killing vector of ds2.

Subcase 2.2.: Let ξi be a non–light–like vector in any region of space.

Then, by construction, it is tangential to the lines of constant values U.
Therefore ξi represents also a Killing vector of ds2.

In both subcases, we get: If the dimension of the isometry group of d ˆΩ2
equals k, then ds2 possesses a k + 1–dimensional isometry group, at least

locally.

9

The boundaries of the cases 1 and 2.1., 2.2., can be covered by a continuity

argument.

5 The 2-dimensional picture (way

via fourth-

order gravity)

In this section, we consider gravity in two dimensions in the two conformally

related frames dσ2 and d˜σ2, and the additional scalar ﬁeld U. The three

essential equations are (3.19), (4.1) and (4.2). We repeat them here for

convenience.

R = 2 Λ + n ( 2 U + U,i U ,i )

Λ = ˆΛe−2U − 2U − n U,i U ,i

and the traceless part of

(eU );ij

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

has to vanish. The idea is to write the D-dimensional Einstein–Hilbert action

for the metric ansatz eq. (2.1). Eqs. (3.6, 3.12, 3.16) can be subsumed to

(D) R = R + nˆΛe−2U − n(n + 1)U,iU ,i − 2n2U

(5.4)

The 2–dimensional Lagrangian is obtained after integrating the n-dimensio-

nal part; the gradient of U can be eliminated from (5.4) by applying the fact

that

(enU U ,i);i = enU (2U + nU ,iU,i)

represents a divergence. Then we get the density

L = [R − (n − 1)2U − nΛ + nˆΛe−2U ]enUq|g|

(5.5)

10

where g = det gij is the two-dimensional determinant, and enU is left over

from the n-dimensional integration. For n = 1 we can take this form as it

stands, but for n > 1 we apply a conformal transformation

˜gij = e(n−1)U gij

to remove the term with 2U. Analogously to eqs. (3.8), (3.12) we get

and the corresponding Lagrangian scalar

˜R = [R − (n − 1)2U]e−(n−1)U

˜L = enU ˜R − nΛeU + nˆΛe−U

fulﬁls L = ˜Lq|˜g|, and it holds: Variation of this L with respect to U and ˜gij

gives a system of equations equivalent to eqs. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3). In the next step

(subsection 5.2.), we try to write this as one single Lagrangian depending on

the two–dimensional metric only, i.e., we want to eliminate the scalar U, and
this is possible if one takes a Lagrangian non-linear in ˜R as will be shown in

subsection 5.1.

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

5.1 Transformation between fourth and second order

Here we give a more complete description of that transformation which was

sketched in (2.4), (2.5) of ref.
Lagrangian in two dimensions, i.e., G = dL
we assume G > 0) and dG

[9] already. Let L = L(R) be a non–linear
dR 6= 0 (without loss of generality
dR 6= 0. The fourth–order ﬁeld equation following

from the variation of Lq|g| with respect to gij has the trace

0 = GR − L + 2G

(5.9)

and the trace–free part of G;ij must vanish. (For dimension 3 or higher, one
must instead ensure the vanishing of the traceless part of G;ij − GRij which

11

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

is not an equivalent requirement, see e.g. ref.

[17]. Therefore, the key of

the proof that eq. (4.3) represents a Killing vector is seen to rest on the

dimension 2 where the traceless part of Rij automatically vanishes.)

Now, we introduce a scalar ﬁeld ϕ by G = e−2ϕ. We invert this relation

to R = R(ϕ) which is (at least locally) possible because of our assumptions.

Then we deﬁne

V (ϕ) = e−2ϕR(ϕ) − L(R(ϕ))

and the Lagrangian can now be written as

L(ϕ, R) = e−2ϕ R − V (ϕ)

If we take this L(ϕ, R) as new starting point, then the ﬁeld equations become

equivalent: variation with respect to ϕ simply reads

0 = 2 e−2ϕR +

dV
dϕ

The variation of Lq|g| with respect to the metric gives the trace

0 = V (ϕ) + 2(e−2ϕ)

(5.13)

and the traceless part of (e−2ϕ);jk vanishes. The two second–order eqs. (5.12,

5.13) on the one hand and the single fourth–order eq. (5.9) on the other hand

are equivalent.

[Let us add the following: We may overcome the singular

point G = 0 by observing that L and L + αR for a constant α give rise to

the same fourth–order ﬁeld equation; the related G will be increased by α,

and the ﬁeld ϕ changes in a non–linear manner.]

Now we go the other direction: Let V (ϕ) be given and we take the La-

grangian (5.11). By eq. (5.12) we calculate R = R(ϕ). First case: This R
is a constant. This takes place if L = e−2ϕ(R − Λ) with any constant Λ.
This is the case where the transformation to fourth–order gravity becomes

impossible.

12

Second case: This R is not a constant function. This takes place if the

potential V fulﬁls the inequality

d2V
dϕ2 + 2

dV
dϕ 6= 0

(5.14)

Then we can invert to ϕ = ϕ(R) and insert this into L(R) = L(ϕ(R), R).

This is the desired non–linear Lagrangian leading to a fourth-order ﬁeld equa-

tion equivalent that one following from eq. (5.11).

5.2 Application of this transformation

The transformation given in subsection 5.1.

shall now be applied to the

system eq. (5.8) in the tilted version. Eqs. (5.8) and (5.11) get the same
structure if we put U = −2ϕ/n and

V (ϕ) = nΛe−2ϕ/n − nˆΛe2ϕ/n

(5.15)

Then the tilted version of eq. (5.12) leads to

˜R(ϕ) = e2ϕ[Λe−2ϕ/n + ˆΛe2ϕ/n]

(5.16)

First case: This value ˜R is constant. (For n = 1, we have always ˆΛ = 0, so

that n = 1 is always subsumed under this ﬁrst case.) Then the transformation

to fourth-order gravity is impossible.

Second case: n ≥ 2 and either Λ or ˆΛ is non–vanishing. Then inequality
(5.14) is fulﬁlled and the fourth–order Lagrangian can be given, but not

always in closed form. Therefore we restrict to two typical examples:

First example: Λ = 0 and ˆΛ = 1. We get the Lagrangian

˜L = (n + 1) ˜R1/(n+1)

(5.17)

In such a context, this Lagrangian was ﬁrst deduced by Rainer and Zhuk,

ref. [18, eq. (3.9)].

13

Second example: Λ = 1 and ˆΛ = 0. We get

˜L = (1 − n) ˜R1/(1−n)

(5.18)

i.e., in both cases we get scale-invariant fourth-order gravity where the Birk-

hoﬀ theorem and the corresponding solutions are known.

6 Summary

We discussed the warped product metric ansatz (cf. eqs. (2.1), (5.6))

ds2 = e(1−n)U (xi)d˜σ2 + e2U (xi)d ˆΩ2

(6.1)

where

d˜σ2 = ˜gij(xk)dxidxj

i, j, k = 0, 1

is a two–dimensional metric and

d ˆΩ2 = ˆgAB(xC)dxAdxB

A, B, C = 2, . . . n + 1

is n-dimensional, n ≥ 1. The question was: Under which circumstances eq.
(6.1) represents an Einstein space in D = n + 2 dimensions ? First, d ˆΩ2 has

to be an Einstein space in n dimensions, i.e., eq. (3.14) has to be fulﬁlled
with ˆΛ = const. (it must vanish for n = 1). Second, we introduced the scalar

ﬁeld ϕ via eq. (5.15)

U = −2ϕ/n

and got an equation of 2-dimensional dilaton gravity. The latter can be

rewritten as fourth–order gravity in two dimensions.

To ease reading, we restrict now to the case Λ = 0 and ˆΛ = 1, i.e., ds2 is
Ricci-ﬂat, and for d ˆΩ2, metric and Ricci tensor coincide (i.e. n ≥ 2). Then
eq. (5.16) implies

(6.2)

(6.3)

˜R = e2ϕ(n+1)/n

14

Inserting eqs. (6.2), (6.3) into eq. (6.1) we get

ds2 = ˜R(n−1)/(n+1)d˜σ2 + ˜R−2/(n+1)d ˆΩ2

(6.4)

Under these circumstances it holds: Metric (6.4) is D-dimensional Ricci ﬂat

if d˜σ2 is a solution of the 2-dimensional fourth–order scale–invariant gravity
following from the Lagrangian (5.17) ˜L = (n + 1) ˜R1/(n+1) with ˜R 6= 0. (If
˜R < 0, we have to write | ˜R| instead of ˜R.) And the solutions of 2-dimensional
fourth–order scale–invariant gravity are known in closed form. So, we have

not only proven a generalized Birkhoﬀ theorem for such a warped product

of manifolds, but we have also given a procedure how the solutions can be

found in closed form.

To show how this procedure works, let us deduce the spherically sym-

metric vacuum solution of Einstein’s theory in 4 dimensions. To this end
we put n = 2 into eq. (6.4) and take d ˆΩ2 = dψ2 + sin2 ψdΦ2 as standard

two–sphere. (That every spherically symmetric 4-metric can be written this

way with metric (2.1) is not proven here, but cf. e.g. ref. [6] for this point.)
Eq. (5.17) reads ˜L = 3 ˜R1/3, this is the case k = −2/3 in the notation of ref.
[8], hence, by eqs. (19, 22) of [8] we get

d˜σ2 =

dw2
A(w) − A(w)dy2

(6.5)

4 w−3/2. We put E = 4, and with eqs.

with A(w) = C + E√w and ˜R = E
(6.4), (6.5) we get

ds2 =

1

√w "

dw2

C + 4√w − (C + 4√w)dy2# + wd ˆΩ2

(6.6)

With w = r2, y = t/2, C = −8m this leads to

ds2 =

dr2
1 − 2m

r − (1 −

2m
r

)dt2 + r2[dψ2 + sin2 ψdΦ2]

(6.7)

i.e., the correct Schwarzschild solution. (The generalization to higher dimen-

sion n is straightforwardly done.)

15

The transformation presented here is of a similar structure to that one

presented in [19]; however, in [19] the two–dimensional case for dσ2 was

excluded, and here we solely restricted to that two–dimensional case. In this

sense, both approaches are disjoint. The ansatz eq. (4.3) as Killing vector

for 2–dimensional models has already be applied several times, e.g. in refs.

[8] and [20].

It should be mentioned that at no place the signature of space-time was

used, so the Birkhoﬀ theorem is shown to be valid in any signature. The

direct way in sct. 4 is equivalent to the way via fourth-order gravity in sct.

5. For both ways the whole proof was done in a fully covariant manner, i.e.,

no special coordinates had to be introduced. So we also circumvented the

discussion whether the introduction of Schwarzschild coordinates represents

a loss of generality or not.3 The key element of the proof follows from the

fact that the traceless part of the Ricci tensor in two dimensions identically
vanishes, i.e., for the scalar U, the traceless part of ( eU );ij must vanish. As
a consequence, ξi = ǫij ( eU );j could be proven to be a Killing vector.
