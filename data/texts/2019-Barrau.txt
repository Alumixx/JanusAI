The idea that dark matter could be made of stable relics of microscopic black holes is not new. In this
article, we revisit this hypothesis, focusing on the creation of black holes by the scattering of trans-
Planckian particles in the early Universe. The only new physics required in this approach is an unusually
high-energy scale for inflation. We show that dark matter emerges naturally and we study the question of
fine-tuning. We finally give some lines of thoughts for a possible detection.

I. INTRODUCTION

Dark matter is a very old problem. On the experimental
side, it is being actively searched for, by direct detection
(see, e.g., [1–3] for reviews), by indirect detection (see, e.g.,
[4–6] for reviews), and by accelerator production (see, e.g.,
[7,8] for reviews). Many “little anomalies” are known, from
the Fermi excess of GeV gamma rays [9] to the PAMELA
and AMS-02 overabundance of positrons [10–12]. All of
them can however be quite simply accounted for by
conventional astrophysical processes and at this stage no
clear signal for nonbaryonic dark matter has been unam-
biguously recorded.

On the theoretical side, many hypotheses are being
considered. They are actually too numerous to be exhaus-
tively mentioned here (see, e.g., [13] for an introductory
review). From supersymmetry [14] to axions [15], most
of them imply some amount of “new physics.” Recent
developments even include an impressive list of highly
speculative hypotheses.

Obviously, estimating the “exoticity” of a model is quite
subjective. In this brief article, we revisit the idea of dark
matter made of Planck relics and we argue that this scenario
might be much less exotic than most models. The only
nonstandard hypothesis is a higher than usual reheating
temperature.

II. TRANS-PLANCKIAN SCATTERING

are relying on production mechanisms that involve the

collapse of overdense regions (see, e.g., [16] for an early
detailed calculation, [17,18] for studies of phase transitions,
and [19,20] for reviews). Those scenarios are however very
unlikely as the density contrast required to form a PBH is
close to 1, whereas the primordial power spectrum mea-
sured in the cosmological microwave background (CMB)
has a much lower normalization. This bound could have
been circumvented by a blue power spectrum as the scales
involved in the formation of PBHs are much smaller than
those probed by the CMB. The actual spectrum, however,
happens to be red (ns ≈ 0.965) [21], making the production
of primordial black holes by “historical” mechanisms very
difficult. Other scenarios like the collapse of cosmic strings
were also considered [22] but they are also disfavored—if
not ruled out—by recent measurements. Interesting new
ideas are, however, now being considered [23,24].

Nevertheless, there exists a very different way to produce
small black holes, namely, through the scattering of trans-
Planckian particles. As initially argued in [25], when the
impact parameter is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius
(associated with the considered center-of-mass energy of a
particle collision), the cross section for the scattering of
trans-Planckian particles is dominated by an inelastic
process leading to the formation of a single black hole.
The key point is that the main features of high-energy
scattering above the Planck energy can be studied from
semiclassical considerations in general relativity and are
therefore reliable.

Basically, at

impact parameters greater

than the
Schwarzschild radius, elastic and inelastic processes (gravi-
tational radiation, bremsstrahlung for charged particles,
etc.) are described by solving the classical equations of the
low-energy theory with initial conditions described by a
pair of shock waves with appropriate quantum numbers.
At smaller impact parameters, scattering is dominated by
the resonant (in a sense different from the classical Breit-
Wigner one) production of a black hole with mass equal to

the center-of-mass energy. The elastic cross section is
suppressed by a Boltzmann factor and the incoming
particles never get close enough together to perform a
hard QCD scattering. In this limit the eikonal approxima-
tion for the initial state becomes valid and is described by a
metric containing a pair of Aichelburg-Sexl shock waves
with the associated impact parameter.

In [26], the study was refined and it was also concluded
that the cross section for black hole production should be
of the order of σðsÞ ¼ FðsÞπR2
ðsÞ with FðsÞ being factor
the center-of-mass energy, and RS the
of order 1,
Schwarzschild radius. The details obviously depend on the
considered quantum gravity theory but the main features
are basically model independent.

S

Those ideas were applied to the possible production and
observation of microscopic black holes at colliders (see,
e.g., [26–29] for early works) in theories with a low Planck
scale—typically in the TeV range (usually associated with
the existence of large extra dimensions [30] or with many
new particle species [31]). A nice review including astro-
physical effects, like those mentioned in [32], can be found
in [33]. In this article, we do not rely on the existence of
extra dimensions and we do not assume a low Planck scale.

III. STABLE RELICS

The Hawking temperature TH ¼ 1=ð8πMÞ [34] is van-
ishingly small for astrophysical black holes but becomes
significant for very small black holes. The mass loss rate
during the evaporation is proportional to M−2 and the
process is therefore highly explosive. In itself, the evapo-
ration mechanism is well understood from many different
perspectives and is very consensual (see, e.g., [35] for a
simple introduction). Although it has not been observatio-
nally confirmed, there are indications that it might have
been revealed in analog systems [36].

The status of the end point of the evaporation process is
less clear. Obviously, the semiclassical treatment breaks
down in the last stages and the divergence of the temper-
ature together with the appearance of a naked singularity is
nonphysical. Many different arguments have been pushed
forward in favor of the existence of stable Planck relics at
the end of the evaporation process (see [37–50] to mention
only a few historical references, among many others).
There are excellent arguments from quantum gravity, string
gravity, or modified gravity theories in favor or remnants.
Those are however obviously based on new physics. One of
the best arguments for Planck relics using only known
physics was given by Giddings in [51]. Locality, causality,
and energy conservation considered within the information
paradox framework (see, e.g., the first sections of [52] for a
precise description) do suggest that the time scale for the
final decay of BHs is larger than the age of the Universe.
Although no clear consensus exists on the status of BHs
at the end of the evaporation process, it is fair to suggest
that the existence of relics is somehow simpler from the

viewpoint of usual physics. A recent review on the pros
and cons of stable remnants can be found in [53]. It is
concluded that if relics contain a large interior geometry—
which is supported by [54,55]—,
they help solve the
information loss paradox and the firewall controversy.

IV. REHEATING SCALE

The idea that dark matter could be made of Planck
relics was first suggested in [56]. This seminal work was,
however, focused on PBHs formed by the collapse of
overdense regions (or similar mechanisms), which is now
believed to be extremely unlikely as previously pointed out.
We focus here on the possibility that PBHs are formed by
the collision of
trans-Planckian particles in the early
Universe. This has already been considered in [57] and
in [58,59] (see also references therein) for the case with
extra dimensions.

that

In this work, we do not assume a lower than usual Planck
scale due to extra dimensions. We quite simply consider the
standard cosmological scenario in a (3 þ 1)-dimensional
spacetime and just take into account the “tail” of trans-
Planckian particles at the reheating time. The key point lies
in the fact
the potentially produced relics behave
nonrelativistically and are therefore much less diluted (their
energy density scales as a−3) than the surrounding radiation
(whose energy density scales as a−4). Hence, it is possible
to reach a density of relics (normalized to the critical
density) close to 1, Ωrel ≡ ρrel=ρcr ≈ 1, with only a tiny
fraction of relics at
the formation time. The relative
“amplification” of the relics density compared to the
radiation density between the reheating and the equilibrium
times is given by TRH=Teq ≈ 3 × 1027TRH when TRH is
given in Planck units. To fix ideas, for a reheating temper-
ature at the grand unified theory (GUT) scale, a relics
fraction of only 10−24 at the formation time would be
enough to nearly close the Universe at the equilibrium time.
For a thermal distribution of particles at temperature T,
the number of particles above Eth > T is exponentially
suppressed. This is why, even with the amplification factor
given above, the scenario presented here requires a reheating
temperature not much below the Planck scale. This con-
stitutes, in our view, the only “nonstandard” input of this
model. The Planck experiment final results lead to an upper
limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial perturbations
r < 0.1 [60], which is even tightened to r < 0.064 by
combining the data with the BICEP2/Keck Array BK14
measurements. This is usually interpreted as an upper limit on
the energy scale of inflation around the GUT scale (the higher
the energy scale, the larger the normalization of tensor
modes), which is too low for the process considered here.
There are, however, at least two ways to circumvent this
bound (we assume for simplicity a sudden reheating).

The first one consists in noticing that the upper limit
on the energy scale of inflation holds firmly only for

rudimentary models.
the relation
basically becomes r ¼ −8CSnt
(instead of r ¼ −8nt),
where nt is the tensor index and CS < 1 is the speed of
sound for perturbations. This relaxes the bound. In two-
field inflation [62],
is also relaxed to
r ¼ −8nt sin2ðθÞ, where θ accounts for the possible evo-
lution of adiabatic scalar modes on super-Hubble scales.
In multifield inflation the relation between r and nT even
becomes an inequality.

the upper limit

A second and probably more provocative argument
would be the following. Whereas temperature anisotropies
originate from usual quantum physics, namely, from the
quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field,
the tensor
perturbations leading to B modes in the CMB should come
from the quantum fluctuations of the polarization modes
of the graviton. In a sense (and although some counter-
examples have been constructed but for artificial models),
B modes would be a signature of perturbative quantum
gravity (dimensional arguments are given in [63]).
Quantum gravity is a fascinating area of research but it
has still no connection with experiments and assuming
gravity not to be quantized is also legitimate, especially
when considering how difficult and paradoxical the quan-
tization of the gravitational field is [64]. It is therefore
meaningful to consider the possibility that no B mode is
produced, even with a very high-energy scale for inflation,
just because gravity might not be quantum in nature (this
would also raise many consistency questions but is obvi-
ously worth being considered, as advocated in [65,66]). In
such a case, the usual upper bound could also be ignored.
the normalization of the scalar spectrum
would also be in tension with such a high scale (violating
the slow-roll conditions in the most simple cases). We do
not mean that a higher than usual energy scale for inflation
is unavoidable or even favored. We simply state that this is
not ruled out by the tensor-to-scalar ratio and might be, in
our opinion, less “exotic” than most assumptions required
for usual DM candidates.

Obviously,

V. DARK MATTER ABUNDANCE

The threshold energy Et to produce a BH in a head on
collision of particles is expected to be of the order of the
Planck energy but, depending on the details of
the
considered model, might be slightly different and we keep
it as a free parameter. To estimate the number density of
particles above Et, one simply needs to integrate the
thermal distribution, which leads to

npart ≈ TRHe−Et=TRH;

where we use Planck units (as everywhere in this work
except otherwise specified). Obviously,
if the reheating
temperature is too small when compared to the threshold
energy of BH production, the number of PBHs will be
exponentially suppressed and the process will be inefficient.

The cross section, in principle, depends on the energy of
the collision but, as a fist step, can be assumed to be a
constant σBH above the threshold. The collision rate is
therefore given by Γ ¼ npartσBHv ≈ npartσBH. The energy
density of radiation is

VI. THE FINE-TUNING ISSUE

The model presented here seems to require a high level
of fine-tuning. In particular, as the dependency upon the
reheating temperature is exponential, varying slightly its
value leads to a large variation in the density of relics. One
can easily check that

to remain in agreement with data. Unquestionably, the
model requires a very high level of fine-tuning.

The question of fine-tuning is, however, tricky. It is only
well defined relatively to an a priori specific state. In the
cosmological framework, the value Ω ¼ 1 is clearly such a
special case. As is well known, inflation fixes a vanishing (or
nearly so) curvature. Basically, as ðΩ−1 − 1Þ ¼ − 3k
8πρa2 with
ρ remaining constant and the scale factor increasing by at
least 60 e-folds, Ω is fixed (close) to 1 at the end of inflation.
There is obviously nothing magical here as Ω involves a nor-
malization to the critical density that, itself, depends on the
Hubble parameter. Should the content of the Universe be
different, we would still have Ω ¼ 1, with a different
expansion rate. This means that changing the parameters
of this model would, in fact, not drive the Universe out of the
specific situation Ω ¼ 1. In this sense it does not require fine-
tuning.

One might argue that if the reheating temperature were
different, other parameters of the Universe—e.g., the (un-
normalized) matter density, the equilibrium time, etc.—would
be different. This is correct. But, in our opinion, this is not a
fine-tuning issue. This is just the obvious statement that things
could have been different and that changing parameters do, of
course, change the final state. This is not problematic as long
as the “lost” state was not a very peculiar one.

To summarize, the parameters of the model need to be
fine-tuned so that the relic density closes the Universe at the
equilibrium time—which is a contingent fact—but not to
ensure Ω ¼ 1, which is indeed the a priori specific feature.

VII. DETECTABILITY

Testing this model is challenging. A Planck relic has the
weight of a grain of dust and no other interaction than
gravity to reveal itself to the outer world. Even though the
Planck mass is very small from the gravitational viewpoint,
it is very large from the particle physics viewpoint. The
number density of relics is therefore extremely small, even
if they are to account for all the dark matter. A density of
10−18 relics par cubic meter—that is, one relic per volume
of a million times the one of planet Earth—is enough to
close the Universe. Detection seems hopeless. The cross
section (or greybody factor) hopefully does not tend to 0 for
the absorption of fermions in the low-energy limit [67].
However, even avoiding this catastrophic suppression

a function of the reheating temperature (in Planck units), around
the relevant zone.

S

one is led to a density of relics that can account for
dark matter.
Although the influence is negligible, from now on we
use the cross section σðsÞ ¼ FðsÞπR2
ðsÞ, where RS ¼ 2s.
We set F ¼ 1 above the threshold, but with the dependency
being linear it is easy to extrapolate to any reasonable value.
In Fig. 3, we show the influence of the threshold energy.
The influence of the threshold energy is—as expected—
very large. Interestingly, if nonperturbative effects were to
lower the threshold by 1 order of magnitude with respect
to the expected value, a reheating temperature around
the GUT scale would be enough to produce the required
density of remnants.

It is worth noticing that in the case with extra dimensions
[59], the “allowed” parameter space is defined by ensuring
that the Hubble rate during inflation Hi, together with the
maximal temperature are smaller than the D-dimensional
Planck scale. Meanwhile Hi must remain much larger
than the nucleosynthesis temperature. The formed relics
account for dark matter basically between a Hubble rate
of 10−16 (in usual four-dimensional Planck units) for a
D-dimensional Planck scale of 10−7 to a Hubble rate of
10−3 for a D-dimensional Planck scale equal to MPl.

(which does exist for higher spins), the area involved is of
the order of the Planck one, 10−66 cm2, which indeed
makes direct detection impossible in practice.

We consider here another possibility associated with the
coalescences of relics that have occurred during the history
of the Universe. Contrarily to what is sometimes done for
PBHs we shall not focus on the emission of gravitational
waves whose amplitude would be negligible and frequency
way too high for any detector. However, something else is
also expected to happen in this model. When two remnants
merge, a higher-mass black hole is formed and evaporates
until it reaches again mrel ∼ mPl assumed to be the minimal
one. This should happen preferably via the emission of one
(or a few) quantum close to the Planck energy. Each merging
should therefore emit about a Planck-energy particle, which
is, in principle, detectable. This sketch should of course be
refined but the hypothesis is realistic enough to investigate
whether this path is potentially fruitful.

We estimate the merging rate following [68], which
builds on [69]. It is not hard to show that the probability of
coalescence in the time interval ðt; t þ dtÞ is given by

Although it is well known that TeV photons are absorbed
by interactions with the infrared background and PeV
photons by interactions with the CMB photons, there is no
strong absorption to be expected for Planck-energy pho-
tons. The wavelength of the background photons that
would lead to a center-of-mass energy close to the electron
mass is way larger than any expected background. The
Rmax value can therefore be assumed to be much larger than
for usual high-energy cosmic-ray estimations. For detectors
like Auger [70],
the expected flux is too small for a
detection. For Euso-like instruments [71]—looking at
the atmosphere from the space station—we are led to an

order of magnitude not far from a fraction of an event per
year. For speculative ideas about using giant planets as
cosmic-ray detectors [72], we reach a dozen events per
year. This is obviously a hard task but, interestingly, the
model is clearly not unfalsifiable.

Furthermore, the idea that the Hawking radiation due to
the formed black holes before they become stable relics
might play a role in baryogenesis was considered in [73].
The possibility that
they might have an effect on the
primordial nucleosynthesis should also be considered. In
the case considered in this article—with a true Planck scale
at the four-dimensional value—, the relics are so heavy and
heir number density so small that it is easy to check that the
associated signal would be entirely negligible.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The idea that dark matter could be made of Planck relics is
not new. Nor is the possibility that black holes could be formed
by the scattering of trans-Planckian particles in the early
Universe. In this article we have gathered all the ingredients
and argued that the resulting model is not (that) exotic.
Unquestionably, the very high reheating temperature required
raises questions. We have however explained that the upper
bounds usually considered can be circumvented. Still, build-
ing a consistent cosmological model with such a high scale for
inflation is not trivial and should be considered as a challenge.
There is no obvious solution to the dark matter problem,
which is one of the oldest enigmas of contemporary
cosmology. The scenario suggested here is based on a
minimum amount of new physics, if not only on known
physics. It requires a quite unusual cosmological behavior
but no new particle physics input is needed. From this point
of view, it might be worth being considered seriously.

Several developments would be worth being considered.
(i) The possibility that nonthermal processes do happen
during the reheating, eventually enhancing the high-
energy tail of the distribution, should be studied
with care.

(ii) The model presented in this article should be
investigated in the context of noninflationary bounc-
ing cosmologies, expected to be more favorable to
this scenario.

(iii) The experimental possibilities that were outlined
should be made more precise thanks to Monte Carlo
simulations.

(iv) in addition to the possible detection of extremely
high-energy gamma rays, it might be interesting to
consider a possible low-energy (in the 100 MeV
range) signal due to the disintegration of neutral
pions produced by the hadronization of quarks or
gluons emitted by the merging of relics.
