In this paper, we focus on the Janus symplectic group. We explore its various symmetries
and its action on the elements of the dual of its Lie algebra, called torsors. Special atten-
tion is given to the charge symmetry, which highlights the matter–antimatter duality
within both sets of components.

Keywords: Dynamic groups; symplectic groups; Lorentz group, Poincar´e group; Janus
group; torsors of a Lie group; action on the torsors.

1. Introduction

The application of the coadjoint action of a symplectic group on the dual of its
Lie algebra, initiated by the mathematician Jean-Marie Souriau, has shed light on
speciﬁc aspects of the approach followed by physics. The orbit method is due to
Kirillov ([4–7, 12, 13, 15, 21, 24, 25]).

Thus, the restricted Lorentz symplectic group, limited to its two orthochrone
components, translates, through the invariance properties that result from it, the
aspects of special relativity. In 1970, Souriau established that the analysis of the
components of its moment makes it possible to shed light on the geometric nature

of a spin (not quantized): see [19, 20]. He uses for this purpose symplectic methods
([8, 10, 22, 23]). In the theory of symplectic groups, we show a classiﬁcation in
terms of movements.

By operating the product of this group by that of the spatio-temporal trans-
lations, we obtain the restricted Poincar´e symplectic group, always limited to its
two orthochrone components. In its moment, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the energy related to
the subgroup of temporal translations. Then the momentum, linked to the spatial
translations, the two being linked by the invariance of the modulus of the energy-
momentum four-vector under the action of the Lorentz group.

By adding a translation along a ﬁfth dimension to the restricted Poincar´e group,
we form a Lie group to which we will give the name Restricted Kaluza Group
([1–3, 11, 14]). This group is not the 15-dimensional Kaluza group associated with
a 5-dimensional Lorentzian manifold but a new 11-dimensional group, including
5-dimensional space-time translation. This new dimension endows the momentum
with an additional scalar that can be identiﬁed with the electric charge q, which
may be positive, negative, or zero, and is still not quantized. We then bring out
the geometric translation according to a scalar φ due to endowing the masses with
an invariant electric charge. Then, by bringing in a new symmetry reﬂecting the
inversion of the ﬁfth dimension, synonymous with an inversion of the scalar from q
to −q, we double the number of its connected components from 2 to 4. The action
on the moment then links this new symmetry to the inversion of the electric charge
q. We thus deduce the geometric modeling of charge conjugation or C-Symmetry.a
It’s then logical to name this new extension, the Restricted Janus Group.

By introducing a new symmetry to the previous group, which we describe
as T-Symmetry,b we build the Janus Symplectic Group. Thus, we double the
number of connected components from four to eight, grouped into two subsets:
“Orthochronous”, conserving time and energy properties, and “Antichronous”,
reversing time and energy. Therefore, we bring forth the geometric translation
of endowing masses with an invariant electric charge. As the Jean-Marie Souriau
demonstrated as early as 1970, a pioneer in the theory of symplectic groups
([9, 19, 20]), this approach has allowed key elements, which have marked the
progress of relativistic physics, to be given a purely geometric nature.

In relation to the world of physics, wouldn’t the role of mathematics be to illumi-
nate the path traveled? Conversely, could it be possible that the exploration of new
symmetries, accompanying this decoding using symplectic groups, contains more
than what we thought we put into it? That it could designate new paths to follow?
This is what we will consider with the Janus Symplectic Group with charge sym-
metry, by integrating the antichronous components of the Lorentz group, resulting

awhich translates the matter–antimatter symmetry introduced by Dirac.
bwhich converts matter into antimatter with negative mass, a concept we could name antimatter
in the Feynman sense.

∀ λ, ν ∈ {0, 1}, Lor( ˜P

Then, we deﬁne the Janus symplectic group.
Deﬁnition 2.1. The Janus symplectic group is deﬁned as the subgroup of GL(6, R):

The Janus symplectic group is therefore a subgroup of the group of isometries

with τ1,4(L) := I1,4LT I1,4 and O(1, 4) := {L ∈ GL(5, R), τ1,4(L)L = I5}. The
elements of Aﬀ(O(1, 4)) are the elements which preserve the distance between two
events (pentavectors) X := (t, x, y, z, ξ) and X(cid:48) := (t(cid:48), x(cid:48), y(cid:48), z(cid:48), ξ(cid:48)) given by
d(X, X(cid:48)) := c2(t − t(cid:48))2 − (x − x(cid:48))2 − (y − y(cid:48))2 − (z − z(cid:48))2 − (ξ − ξ(cid:48))2.

cEqualities are shown by double inclusion. For example, let’s demonstrate that Lors = Lor( ˜P
).
Take L ∈ Lors (det(L) = −1 et [L]00 ≥ 1). Then we have det(L ˜P) = −1 and [L ˜P]00 ≥ 1 i.e.
we have Ln := L ˜P ∈ Lorn. Since ˜P

inclusion in the other direction is trivial.
dAﬀ(O(1, 4)) is the aﬃne group associated with O(1, 4), it is also deﬁned by the semi-direct
product Aﬀ(O(1, 4)) := O(1, 4) (cid:110) R5. We can also deﬁne the symplectic Janus group as being the
aﬃne group associated with the subgroup of O(1, 4) given by

This ﬁfth dimension is of space type (we note the variable ξ). Each dimension is
therefore associated with a symmetry, there are three types of symmetries:
• the T-symmetry;
• the Px-symmetry, Py-symmetry, Pz-symmetry grouped together what we call
• the ξ-symmetry corresponding to the C-symmetry (the charge conjugation).

3. Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have performed a double extension of the restricted Poincar´e group
limited to its orthochronous components, which are classically used in physics. This
extension also includes the transition from the four-dimensional Minkowski space-
time to a new space of the same dimension, to which we have added a translation
along an additional ﬁfth dimension to form a new Lie group. The existence of this
additional subgroup results in the invariance of a scalar, identiﬁed as the electric
charge. A symmetry is introduced along this ﬁfth dimension, and we have shown
that this leads to the inversion of the electric charge. This provides a geometric
representation of the symmetry between matter and antimatter.

In 1905, Albert Einstein revolutionized physics by introducing the theory of
special relativity, integrating time, via the constant c, as a coordinate comparable
to spatial dimensions in the geometry of Minkowski space. Ten years later, with his
ﬁeld equation, he explained phenomena such as the precession of Mercury’s perihe-
lion and the deﬂection of light, while laying the foundations of modern cosmology.
The Big Bang theory, supported by Edwin Hubble’s observations and Friedmann’s
work, revealed that the early universe was characterized by extreme density and
temperature conditions.

Simultaneously, quantum mechanics emerged with the discovery of antimatter
by Paul Dirac, an essential postulate in the cosmological model where, a fraction of
a second after the Big Bang, matter and antimatter coexisted in equilibrium with
gamma photons. However, the progressive disappearance of antimatter, implied
by annihilations, remains a mystery, reinforced by the discovery of the cosmic
microwave background in 1965.

Study of symmetries through the action on torsors

The paradox of baryonic asymmetry found a theoretical response in 1967 with
Sakharov, who postulated the existence of a twin universe symmetric to ours accord-
ing to CPT symmetry, containing antimatter and evolving with an opposite arrow
of time [16–18]. This model is based on a natural extension of fundamental sym-
metries, although the complete separation of the two universes leaves unresolved
questions.

Within the framework of a geometric approach via dynamical groups, and build-
ing on the theory of symplectic groups by Souriau [20], we consider here an extension
of Sakharov’s model, the Janus model. The latter proposes an alternative vision
where the two universes, far from being disjoint, are connected by a covering struc-
ture. This conﬁguration allows gravitational interaction between particles of oppo-
site masses, thereby redeﬁning CPT symmetry in a larger geometric framework,
including the antichronous components of the Poincar´e group.

In conclusion, this approach not only sheds light on the path physics has taken
but also suggests new avenues, oﬀering a possible resolution to contemporary crises
in cosmology, as evidenced by the data from the Hubble and James Webb tele-
scopes. A more detailed study will be presented, including a system of coupled ﬁeld
equations modeling the gravitational interactions induced by these new symmetries.
