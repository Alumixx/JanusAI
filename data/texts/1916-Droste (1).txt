I  have 
demonstrated  that  the  quantity  of  different  elements  accumulated  in 
the  ceUs  of  Aspe1''[Jillus  n~qe1'  is  subject  to  \'ery great variations.  The 
investigatioll  was  carl'Ïed  ollt  quantitatively  for  carbon,  nitrogen and 
phosphorlls  and  qnalitatively  for  the  element  sulphur  Whel'eas from

instanee,  are  absol'bed  aftel'  tbree  days  in  the  fungolls  material, thls 
aftel'  21  days  amollnts  to  only  31,  s?  not  quite  60°/0  ofthe qllantity 
origillally 
taken  up.  The  same  applies  to  the  nitrogen  and  pal:ti 
culady  to  the  phosphol'uS  in  a  still  higher  degree, 
Tbe  quantity  of  J1itrogen  present  in  the  cells  falls  in  course  of 
time  to  2/5-1/3  of  the  quantity  present  in  the  young  eells  and with 
to  1/7-1/1°'  Also  the  sulphul'  is  accumulated  in 
phosvhorus  even 
yonng  celis.  On 
increasing  age 
the  superfluous  quantities  of  the 
said  elements  are  excl'eted,

On  account  of  experimental  difficulties.I  have  glven  up  the  idea 
of  detel'mming 
the 
oxygen  separately,  but  have  now  decided  to  calclllate  the  sum  of 
these  two  elements  accumulated  in  different  pel'iods  in  the  fnugous 
materlal.  Fol',  if  we  know  the  quantity  of  dry  substance,  likewise 
the  percentage  of  carbon,  nitrogen,  pho&phorus  and  ash, it is possible 
to  determine  with  sufficient  accuracy  fo)'  my  pllrpose  the  joint 
amollnt  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen.
