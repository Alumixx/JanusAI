Abstract:	
It	is	recalled	that	the	construction	of	special	relativity	and	then	general	relativity	was	
based	on	changes	in	the	geometric	paradigm.	Starting	from	the	difficulties	encountered	
by	the	LCDM	model,	we	propose	this	change	of	geometric	paradigm	represented	by	the	
Janus	cosmological	model,	specifying	its	topological	bases,	its	structure	as	a	two-sheet	
covering	of	a	projective	P4	and	its	associated	dynamical	group	structure.	We	show	he	
such	geometry	of	spacetime	goes	with	PT-symmetry.	This	is	completed	by	the	
construction	of	its	system	of	coupled	field	equations	from	an	action	
____________________________________________________________________________________________________	
1	-	Introduction.		
Recent	observations	show	that	the	current	cosmological	model,	the	LCDM	model,	which	
is	considered	to	be	standard,	is	confronted	with	a	growing	number	of	contradictions.	
These	include	the	discovery	of	the	lacunar	structure	of	the	universe,	the	early	birth	of	
galaxies	and	first-generation	stars	revealed	by	the	JWST	telescope,	the	lack	of	detection	
of	primeval	dark	matter	and	the	impossibility	of	giving	an	identity	to	dark	energy.	As	a	
result,	a	growing	number	of	scientists	agree	that	it	is	now	legitimate	to	envisage	a	
paradigm	shift,	i.e.	an	attempt	to	go	beyond	the	framework	imposed	by	General	
Relativity.	This	last	model	is	a	perfect	illustration	of	the	geometric	nature	of	successive	
paradigm	shifts.	Prior	to	1905,	space	and	time	were	considered	as	independent	
variables.	A	space	that	was	also	assumed	to	be	Euclidean,	i.e.	defined	by	a	Euclidean	
metric,	operating	in	three	dimensions	of	space

The	transition	to	General	Relativity	means	that	space-time	is	given	a	curvature.	The	
metric	is	no	longer	the	Lorentzian	metric	(2)	but	a	more	general	metric:		
(7)																																																																	
	being	the	metric	tensor.		
This	General	Relativity	is	then	equipped	with	a	field	equation,	introduced	in	1915	[1]	
from	the	Hilbert-Einstein	action:	
(8)																																																										
Where	R	is	the	Ricci	scalar,	L	the	Lagrangian	of	matter,	g	the	determinant	of	the	metric,	
the	Einstein	constant	and	
the	cosmological	constant	.	Its	derivation	leads	to	the	field	
equation:	
(9)																																																												
	
Space-time	then	has	the	structure	of	a	Lorentzian	manifold	M4.	
In	stationary	situations,	theorists	relied	on	the	metric	solutions	introduced	in	1916	by	K.	
Scharzchild	([2],[3]).	However,	from	the	late	1970s	onwards,	in	order	to	account	for	the	
flat	velocity	profiles	at	the	periphery	of	galaxies	and	the	high	velocities	of	galaxies	in	
clusters,	theorists	began	to	consider	the	existence	of	positive-mass	dark	matter	of	an	
unknown	nature	that	escaped	observation.	
For	unsteady	situations,	until	2011	they	used	solutions	to	the	cosmological	constant-free	
equation,	based	on	an	assumption	of	homogeneity	and	isotropy.	But	observations	in	
2011	showed	that	the	cosmic	expansion	was	accelerating	([4],	[5],	[6]).	The	
cosmological	constant	was	then	reintroduced	into	the	equation.		
There	is	one	final	point:	the	absence	of	observations	of	primordial	antimatter.	The	
photons	that	make	up	the	background	radiation	at	2.7°K	are	supposed	to	result	from	the	
annihilation	of	primordial	matter-antimatter	pairs.	Normally,	this	annihilation	should	
have	been	complete	and	it	remains	a	mystery	why	any	matter	particle	survived.	Nor	do	
we	understand	why	its	antimatter	equivalent	has	not	been	detected.	This	is	no	mean	feat,	
in	the	sense	that	we	are	losing	half	the	universe	from	the	outset.		
	2	–	When	André	Sakharov	was	the	first	to	envisage	a	change	in	geometry.		
At	the	stage	we	have	just	described,	the	universe	is	an	orientable	M4	manifold,	including	
a	singular	point,	the	Big	Bang.	There	is	no	limit	to	cosmic	expansion.	Cosmic	acceleration	
gives	space-time	a	negative	curvature	index.

Fig.	1	:		The	standard	universe	model	

	But	the	universe	then	presents	a	matter-antimatter	dissymmetry.	The	existence	of	the	
latter	is	proven:		the	reactions	in	which	the	C-symmetry	appears	take	place	in	different	
timescales.	In	1967,	Sakharov	([7],[8],[9])	therefore	imagined	reconstituting	global	
symmetry	by	endowing	the	knowable	universe	with	a	twin	universe,	CPT-symmetric	
with	our	own.	

	

Fig.	2	:	The	twin	worlds	of	A.	Sakharov.	

	Considering	that	matter	arises	from	the	union	of	quarks	and	antimatter	from	antiquarks,	
as	well	as	the	dissymmetry	already	observed,	he	proposes	that	the	synthesis	of	matter	in	
our	universe	was	faster	than	the	synthesis	of	antimatter.	After	annihilation,	photons	
from	the	annihilations,	a	small	quantity	of	matter	and	an	equivalent	remnant	of	
antiquarks	would	remain	in	our	side	of	the	universe.	The	situation	being	reversed	in	the	
twin	universe.	This	theory	is	currently	the	only	explanation	for	the	proven	absence	of	
cosmological	antimatter.	Note	that	the	Big	Bang	singularity	can	be	replaced	by	a	tubular	
passage.:

Fig.3	:	The	Sakharov	model,	without	singularity.		
	3	–	The	Janus	model:	how	to	fold	this	structure	in	on	itself	[10].		
Before	considering	this,	it	is	necessary	to	assume	that	the	observable	universe	has	the	
topology	of	a	sphere	S2.	Below	is	the	didactic	image	in	2D.		

	

Fig.4	:	Didactic	image	of	spherical	space-time.	

	In	this	didactic	image,	space,	closed	in	on	itself,	is	represented	by	a	simple	circle	which,	
starting	from	a	first	Big	Bang	singularity,	experiences	a	state	of	maximum	expansion,	at	
the	equator,	then	contracts	as	it	converges	towards	a	second	singularity,	known	as	the	
Big	Crunch,	these	two	points	being	antipodal.:

Fig.	5	:	The	Big	Bang	and	the	Big	Crunch,	antipodal.	

	The	idea	of	having	points	in	space-time	interact	with	points	located	at	space-time	
antipodes	was	considered	in	1994	[10].	The	universe	can	then	be	considered	as	the	two-
folds	cover	of	an	inorientable	projective	P4.	To	illustrate	this	idea,	let	us	show	how	a	2D	
spacetime	can	then	be	configured	as	a	two-folds	cover	of	a	P2	projective,	which	can	be	
represented	by	the	surface	imagined	in	1902	by	the	mathematician	Werner	Boy	[11].	
	

	

Fig.	6	:	Boy's	surface,	the	vicinity	of	its	equator	and	the	triple	point.	

	This	triple	point	arises	only	from	the	way	in	which	the	projective	space	P2	is	
represented	as	an	immersion	in	R3.	Similarly,	the	projective	does	not	have	a	helical	self-
intersection	curve.

Fig.7	:	Boy's	surface,	triple	point	and	self-intersection	curve.		

	
	This	only	results	from	the	mode	of	representation	in	the	form	of	an	immersion	in	R3.	
Just	as	the	self-intersection	curve	of	the	Klein	bottle	is	only	the	result	of	this	mode	of	
representation.		

	

Fig.	8	:	Klein	bottle	and	T2	torus.	

	The	T2	torus	is	itself	the	result	of	the	two-folds	covering	of	this	Klein	bottle	K2.	We	can	
endow	the	Boy	surface	with	meridians,	converging	at	its	single	pole.	The	Euler	Poincaré	
characteristic	of	the	Boy	surface	is	unity.	If	we	decide	to	tessellate	it,	this	tessellation	will	
therefore	include	a	single	tessellation	singularity	of	order	unity	[12].		Since	the	
characteristic	of	a	sphere	of	even	dimension	is	2,	this	is	also	the	characteristic	of	the	2D	
sphere,	which	therefore	has	two	tessellation	singularities	of	order	unity,	its	poles.	
During	the	coating	process,	these	two	antipodal	poles	will	coincide.	Let's	look	at	what	
happens	to	the	meridians	of	the	sphere,	which	are	the	neighbors	of	its	time	lines.	These	
will	be	configured	as	a	two-sheet	covering	of	the	meridians	of	Boy's	surface.	Here	are	
three	meridians	of	the	surface.

Fig.10	:	The	equator	of	Boy's	surface:	a	Möbius	strip	with	3	half-turns.	

Next,	the	equator	and	one	meridian:

Fig.	11	:	Boy's	surface,	equator	and	a	meridian.		

The	coating	operation	will	invert	the	arrow	of	time,	as	can	be	seen	in	the	vicinity	of	a	
meridian	time	line,	which	is	then	configured	as	a	two-sheet	coating	of	a	half-turn	Möbius	
strip.:		
	

Fig.12	:	Reversing	time	on	a	meridian.	

This	can	also	be	seen	by	bringing	antipodal	points	on	the	equator	of	a	sphere	S2	into	
coincidence.	

	

	

Fig.13	:	Time	reversal	on	the	equator.	

	

	

10	
	
This	coating	operation	also	induces	an	enantiomorphy	of	adjacent	surface	portions.	Here	
is	an	example	of	the	folding	of	the	equator	of	the	sphere	S2	according	to	the	two-sheet	
coating	of	a	Möbius	strip	with	three	half-turns.			

	

14	–	The	mirror	symmetry	induced	by	the	two-sheet	covering	of	a	projective	P2.	
	In	relation	to	the	Sakharov	model,	we	obtain	the	following:			
	

	

Fig.15	:	Didactic	image	of	the	Janus	model.	

Note	in	passing	that	we	can	then	make	the	singularity	at	the	common	pole	disappear	by	
replacing	it	with	a	small	tube.

Fig.16	:	The	polar	singularity	disappears.	

	

	In	other	words:		

	
Fig.17	:	Cosmological	model	with	no	Big	Bang	singularity.			

	The	object,	whose	Euler-Poincaré	characteristic	is	then	zero,	corresponds	to	the	
configuration	given	to	a	toric	space-time	in	a	two-sheet	covering	of	a	Klein	bottle	K2.		
All	these	operations	can	be	extended	to	a	spacetime	with	the	topology	of	an	orientable	
sphere	S4,	which	is	then	configured	as	a	two-sheet	covering	of	a	projective	P4.	We	know	
that	PN	projectives	are	inorientable	when	N	is	even,	and	orientable	when	N	is	odd.		
These	geometric	considerations	lead	us	to	consider	the	interaction	between	two	
adjacent	regions	of	PT-symmetric	space-time

	4	–	Interpretation	of	T-symmetry	according	to	dynamic	group	theory.	
	The	first	Janus	group,	incorporating	this	PT-symmetry	[13],	is	the	dynamic	group	[14].:		
(10)																																																					
	t	
Lo	is	then	the	subgroup	of	the	complete	Lorentz	group,	or	restricted	Lorentz	group,	
limited	to	its	two	orthochronous	components.	The	value	
then	corresponds	to	this	
PT-symmetry.	The	Lorentz	group	has	four	connect	components.	
Let's	call	Ln	the	neutral	component,	which	contains	the	neutral	element	of	the	group.		
Ls	is	the	component	that	inverts	space	but	not	time.		
Lt	is	the	component	that	inverts	time	but	not	space.		
Lst	is	the	component	that	inverts	both	space	and	time.		
The	first	two	form	the	orthochronous	subgroup	:		
		
(11)																																																																								
The	next	two	are	the	two	antichronous	components::		
	
(12)																																																																									
It	is	clear	that:		
	
(13)																																																																										
This	configuration	would	therefore	cause	two	adjacent	regions	to	interact,	with	the	
action	of	adjacent	masses	being	equivalent	to	that	of	negative	masses	
	3	–	Extension	incorporating	CPT-symmetry.		
The	fact	of	endowing	masses	with	an	electric	charge	has	been	considered	as	the	fact	that	
they	evolve	in	a	five-dimensional	Kaluza	space	([15],	[16]).	If	we	consider	this	fifth	
dimension	as	a	simple	fibre,	this	additional	symmetry,	in	the	form	of	a	simple	translation	
along	this	fifth	dimension,	will	lead	to	the	constancy	of	a	scalar,	the	electric	charge.	The	
associated	group	structure	with	its	action	on	a	five-dimensional	space	is	then	[13]:

The	Janus	group	[13]	translates	the	CPT-symmetry:		
(15)																																								
It	then	has	eight	connex	components.	The	choice	(l =	1	;	 m	=	-	1	)		inverts	the	fifth	
dimension,	which	is	the	geometric	translation	of	C-symmetry	[17].			
The	choice	(l =	-	1	;	m	=		1	)		translates	CPT-symmetry.		
Note:	if	we	want	this	configuration	to	reflect	a	configuration	in	the	covering	of	a	
projective	PN,	N	must	be	even,	otherwise	the	projective	is	orientable	and	we	lose	the	
symmetries	on	time	and	space.	The	extension	can	therefore	be	carried	out	with	an	even	
number	of	additional	dimensions,	using	the	dynamic	group:		
	
(16)					
	
Each	additional	dimension	is	associated	with	an	invariant	scalar.	The	first	is	the	electric	
charge	q.	The	next	are	the	baryonic,	leptonic,	muonic	charges,	etc	.		
If	this	representation	of	charges	is	correct,	then	their	number	should	be	even,	which	
would	fit	in	with	the	10-dimensional	extension	of	string	theory.		
	5-	Integration	of	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	model.	
If	these	masses	of	opposite	signs	interact,	then	according	to	what	laws?	If	we	base	this	
action	on	Einstein's	equation,	we	come	up	against	an	unmanageable	paradox.	If	the	
source	of	the	gravitational	field	is	a	positive	mass,	the	metric	derived	from	this	
hypothesis	gives	geodesics	that	suggest	attraction.		:

Fig.18	:	Geodesics	associated	with	a	field	created	by	a	positive	mass.		

	Positive	masses	are	represented	in	red	and	negative	masses	in	green.	Since	there	is	only	
one	family	of	geodesic	solutions,	we	can	deduce	that	positive	masses	attract	their	
counterparts	just	as	well	as	negative	masses.		Now	let's	look	at	the	field	created	by	a	
negative	m:		

Fig	19	:	Geodesics	associated	with	a	field	created	by	a	negative	mass.	

	Conclusion:	negative	masses	repel	their	counterparts	just	as	well	as	positive	masses.	All	
this	was	studied	and	demonstrated	in	1954	by	Herman	Bondi	([18],	[19]).	Let's	place	
two	masses	of	opposite	signs	in	front	of	each	other:

Positive	mass	flees,	pursued	by	negative	mass.	The	action-reaction	principle	is	violated.	
The	acceleration	of	the	couple	takes	place	at	constant	total	energy,	since	that	of	the	
negative	mass	is	itself	negative.	At	the	time,	the	conclusion	was	that	it	was	impossible	to	
include	negative	masses	in	a	cosmological	model.	It	is	indeed	impossible	with	a	single	
metric.	But	it	becomes	possible	if	we	assign	two	different	metrics	to	adjacent	folds,	
.	These	two	metric	fields	will	then	generate	their	own	field	of	Ricci	tensors	
and		
and	
.	We	will	therefore	have	two	
	as	well	as	the	corresponding	Ricci	scalars	
.			
and		
and	
matter	fields	
.	To	these	we	will	add	two	interaction	tensors	
It	will	then	be	possible	to	construct	a	system	of	two	coupled	field	equations	[23]	through	
the	action

Fig.21	:	Direction	of	forces	in	the	Janus	model.		

	This	satisfies	the	action-reaction	principle.	This	is	due	to	the	minus	sign	in	the	second	
member	of	the	second	equation.		This	system	has	been	developed	in	the	form	of	an	
unsteady	solution,	showing	that	the	acceleration	of	the	expansion	is	due	to	the	
asymmetry	of	the	model	[22],	with	a	pre-eminence	of	the	negative	masses	[13],	which	
then	drives	the	construction	of	the	structure	on	a	very	large	scale	[20].	The	study	of	
geodesics	in	a	stationary	situation	then	reveals	the	confinement	of	positive	masses	by	
their	environment	of	negative	masses	[21].

The	establishment	of	this	asymmetry,	resulting	from	an	instability	of	the	system,	which	
was	initially	symmetrical,	will	be	the	subject	of	a	subsequent	article.	
	
Conclusion	:		
We	recall	that	the	transitions,	first	to	special	relativity	and	then	to	general	relativity,	are	
based	on	paradigmatic	changes	of	a	purely	geometric	nature.	After	discussing	the	
growing	difficulties	encountered	by	the	Standard	Model,	we	move	towards	a	topological	
solution.	After	evoking	Andréi	Sakharov's	attempt,	in	which	his	twin	universes	did	not	
interact,	we	fold	this	model	back	on	itself	by	opting	for	a	two-sheet	covering	of	a	
projective	P4.	We	then	show	that	this	operation	leads	to	a	PT-symmetry.	Extending	this	
model	to	two	CPT-symmetric	entities,	we	consider	the	addition	of	extra	dimensions,	
extending	the	approach	initiated	by	Kaluza.	The	group	structure	is	constructed.	We	then	
show	that	this	extension	implies	the	addition	of	a	necessarily	even	number	of	extra	
dimensions.	We	show	that	a	bimetric	description	is	required	and,	on	the	basis	of	an	
action,	we	produce	a	system	of	coupled	equations	that	satisfies	the	action-reaction	
principle,	thus	escaping	the	unmanageable	runaway	phenomenon..
