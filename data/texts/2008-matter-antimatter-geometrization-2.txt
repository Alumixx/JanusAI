Abstract:

We extend the precedent group to a four-components orthochron set. This operation gives a geometrical interpretation of
antimatter after Dirac.

 
 
 

 

 
 

1- Introduction

In a former paper [1] we have presented a description of elementary particles ins a ten-dimensional space, i.e. space-time (x,y,z,t)
plus six additional dimensions:

  
We presented a 16-dimensions group, an extension of the Poincaré orthochron subgroup, acting on:

{ ζ 1 , ζ 2 , ζ 3 , ζ 4 , ζ 5 , ζ 6 }

- its 16-dimensions momentum space

- its 10-dimensional movement space.

The six additional components of the momentum have been identified to the charges of the particles:

so that the momentum becomes:

{ q , cB , cL , cμ , cτ , ϖ }

Jpe = { q , cB , cL , cμ , cτ , ϖ , Jp }

where Jp represent the classical moment, from the orthochron Poincaré sub-group:

after J.M.Souriau [1].

Jpo = { E , p , f , l }

We have figured the link between the species of moments and the species of movement, suggesting that:

- The movement of matter corresponds to { ζ i > 0 } sector.

- The movement of antimatter corresponds to { ζ i < 0 } sector.

- The movement of photons corresponds to { ζ i = 0 } plane.

  
All that must be now justified.

2- Introducing a four components group. Geometrization of Dirac's antimatter

The precedent 16-dimensional group had two components, correspondong to the two orthochron components of the Lorentz
group, Ln (neutral component) and Ls , with:

Our group was an extension of the orthochron Poincaré sub-group:

Lo (orthochron sub-group) = Ln U Ls

and we wrote it:

Go = Gn U Gs

The corresponding coadjoint action was:

{χ i} = { q , cB , cL , cμ , cτ , ϖ }

In such a group no element transforms the movement of a matter mass-point into the movement of an antimatter mass-point, and
vice versa. According to the chosen definition of antimatter, through a:

some element should reverse the additional dimensions. With:

ζ - Symmetry: {ζ i} ----> {- ζ i}

  
we can write the precedent group into a more compact form:

with:

It contains the neutral element:

The matrix that reverses the additional dimensions is be the following orthochron commuter:

  
We can duplicate the precedent group through the operation:

go × goc

It is equivalent to write the new four component group, whose element is:

The corresponding coadjoint action is:

We see that ( λ = - 1 ) reverses the charges. In that case the inversion of the additional dimensions:

ζ - Symmetry: {ζ i} ----> {- ζ i}

  
goes with a:
(19)

C-symmetry (or charge conjugation):

{ q , cB , cL , cμ , cτ , ϖ } ---> {- q ,- cB ,- cL ,- cμ ,- cτ , - ϖ }

  
which corresponds to Dirac's description of antimatter [4], so that the present paper represents a geometrization of antimatter after
Dirac.
 

3- Coadjoint action on momentum space

In order to make the things clearer we can graphically figure it.
 

Fig.1: The four component orthochron extended group. The (λ=1) components form a a sub-group. 

Below, the momentum space with its three sub-sets, figuring particles', antiparticles' and photons' worlds. 

Associated two-sectors movement space.

 
If we choose an element picked from the ( λ = 1 ) sub-group we refind the schemas presented in the precedent paper [1].

Examine the impact of the orthochron commuter goc on the moment and associated movement.

Now, introduce two coupled orthochron matrixes:

Conclusion
 

We  start from  the  precedent paper  [1],  where  we  introduced  a  16-dimensional  group  acting  on  its  16-dimensions momentum
space and 10-dimensional movement space. As in [1] we follow the basic idea: antimatter corresponds to a ζ-Symmetry, to the
inversion  of  the  additional  variables.  We  define  a  matrix, called orthochron commuter,  which  achieves ζ-Symmetry. Then  we
build a group which contains such element. We get a four components group, composed by the elements go of the ( λ = 1 ) sub-
group, and by conjugated matrixes goc × go , formed through the action of the orthochron commuter goc on this sub-group. The
antimatter becomes another movement of matter, driven by coadjoint action of the group.
