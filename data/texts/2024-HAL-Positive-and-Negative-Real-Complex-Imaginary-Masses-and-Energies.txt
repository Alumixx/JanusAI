complex	Poincaré	group		
Abstract	:	We	review	a	number	of	possible	avenues	for	the	paradigm	shift	necessitated	
by	the	multiple	contradictions	that	are	increasingly	weighing	down	the	entire	Standard	
Model,	 whether	
in	 particle	 physics	 or	 cosmology.	 These	 are	 based	 on	 the	
implementation	of	new	symmetries.	The	convergence	between	what	emanates	from	
quantum	mechanics	and	the	theory	of	dynamical	groups,	i.e.	inversions	of	mass	and	
energy,	is	noted.	An	extension	to	the	complex	field	is	explored.	
On	the	grave	of	the	great	mathematician	David	Hilbert,	in	Göttingen,	we	find	his	motto,	
engraved	on	his	tombstone:		
It's	hard	to	imagine	such	a	limitless	ambition.	But	isn't	it	true	that	the	knowledge	
scientists	are	after	is	constantly	eluding	them?	To	this	we	can	add	a	phrase	attributed	to	
Goethe:	"The	goal	is	the	path".	And	this	is	perhaps	what	the	destiny	of	the	scientist	boils	
down	to:	trying	to	make	progress	in	the	knowledge	-	as	the	history	of	science	attests	-	
that	every	new	step	forward	will	be	taken	to	transcend	a	new	contradiction,	while	
awaiting	the	next	one.		
Theoretical	physics	and	cosmology	have	reached	an	impasse.	For	decades,	Nature	has	
refused	to	fit	into	the	mold	that	theorists	have	constructed.	Particle	physics	predicted	
the	existence	of	superparticles.	But	they	refuse	to	appear.	Until	now,	progress	in	physics	
had	been	linked	to	an	increase	in	the	energy	brought	into	play	in	particle	colliders.	Since	
this	failure,	what	path	should	we	follow?	Some	at	CERN	suggest	building	a	collider	91	
kilometers	in	diameter,	at	a	cost	of	20	billion	euros.		The	aim?	Unspecified.	The	idea	is	
simply	to	venture	into	an	unknown	field.	But	what	if	we	don't	find	anything	definite,	
except	even	more	sprays,	reminiscent	of	the	sparks	flying	from	the	blacksmith's	anvil?	
In	cosmology	and	astrophysics,	dark	matter	refuses	to	be	captured.	Space	telescopes	
have	brought	a	harvest	of	problems.	In	2017,	the	Hubble	telescope	revealed	the	
presence	of	an	immense	void,	a	hundred	million	light-years	away,	600	million	light-

years	from	Earth.	Subsequent	observation	confirmed	a	lacunar	universe	structure.	The	
James	Space	Telescope	added	to	the	confusion	by	discovering	fully-formed	galaxies	300	
million	years	old.	And,	to	round	things	off,	the	first	images	of	hypermassive	objects	at	
the	center	of	the	M87	and	Milky	Way	galaxies,	described	as	giant	black	holes,	don't	have	
perfectly	black	central	parts.	So,	what	could	be	the	way	forward?	Let's	explore	a	few	
avenues.	
	2	–	Possible	existence	of	negative-energy	states	in	quantum	mechanics.		
In	quantum	mechanics,	negative	energy	states	have	long	been	a	subject	of	controversy.	
Quantum	field	theory	uses	the	inversion	operators	of	space	(P)	and	time	(T),	which	can	
be	linear	and	unitary,	or	antilinear	and	antiunitary.	Historically,	physicists	have	often	
avoided	negative	energy	states	by	arbitrarily	choosing	linear	and	unitary	P,	and	
antilinear	and	antiunitary	T.	However,	the	discovery	of	the	accelerating	cosmic	
expansion	in	2011	has	called	this	approach	into	question.	In	the	Einstein	field	equation,	
this	phenomenon	can	be	interpreted	by	the	presence	of	negative	pressure,	a	form	of	
bulk	energy	density.	In	solving	the	Dirac	equation,	Paul	Dirac	discovered	solutions	with	
both	positive	and	negative	energy	terms:	
(1)																																																															  E = ±
	correspond	to	the	positive	energies	expected	for	
The	solutions	with	  E = +
particles,	while	those	with	  E = −
	suggest	the	existence	of	negative-energy	
states.	This	double	solution	is	inherent	in	any	relativistic	theory.	In	quantum	mechanics,	
negative	energy	would	lead	to	a	negative	probability	density,	which	is	physically	
unacceptable	since	negative	probabilities	do	not	exist.	Indeed,	using	the	Klein-Gordon	
equation,	we	have:	
(2)																																																				  
(ψ * ∂t ψ − ψ ∂t ψ * )	
If	the	Ψ	wave	function	is	of	the	plane	wave	type,	we	have:		
(3)																																																										   ψ( !r ,t ) = N e− i( Et− !p.!r )	
Substituting	this	function	into	jo	expression	gives:		
(4)																																							  
	
This	shows	that	jo	is	proportional	to	E.	Thus,	a	negative	energy	E	leads	to	a	negative	
probability	density,	which	is	not	acceptable	in	quantum	mechanics.	
Solutions	to	the	Dirac	equation	pose	a	similar	challenge.	Dirac	introduced	four	solutions:	
two	with	positive	energy	and	two	with	negative	energy.	To	get	around	this	problem,	
Stueckelberg	and	Feynman	proposed	that	negative-energy	particles	be	interpreted	as	
traveling	backwards	in	time.	This	means	that,	by	changing	the	direction	of	time,	negative	
energy	can	be	transformed	into	positive	energy.	Feynman	illustrated	this	idea	with

diagrams,	where	particles	moving	backwards	in	time	are	seen	as	antiparticles.	For	
example,	an	electron	with	negative	energy	can	be	interpreted	as	a	positron	moving	
backwards	in	time.	
Dirac,	however,	criticized	this	approach,	asserting	that	negative-energy	states	must	be	
taken	into	account.	Each	negative-energy	state	solution	corresponds	to	an	antiparticle	
with	an	opposite	charge.		
CPT	(charge,	parity	and	time)	symmetry	plays	an	important	role	in	quantum	physics.	
The	combined	C,	P	and	T	transformations	maintain	the	coherence	of	quantum	states.	For	
example,	C	charge	conjugation	transforms	a	particle	into	its	antiparticle	by	inverting	the	
charge:	
	
	
(5)																																																																  C ψ = iγ 2ψ *	
By	applying	this	transformation,	Dirac	solutions	can	be	related	to	Feynman-
Stueckelberg	solutions.	The	γ5	transformation,	defined	by	:	
(6)																																																														  γ 5 = γ oγ 1γ 2 γ 3	
connects	positive	and	negative	energy	states	by	inverting	the	mass:	
+	
(7)																																																							  ψ1
This	transformation	suggests	that	negative	energies	are	acceptable	if	associated	with	
negative	masses.		
Thus,	through	examination	of	the	Dirac	and	Feynman-Stueckelberg	solutions	and	the	
discrete	symmetries	C,	P	and	T,	the	unitary	application	of	the	T	operator	and	antiunitary	
application	of	the	P	operator	to	the	Dirac	equation	enables	particles	of	positive	energy	
and	mass	to	be	transformed	into	their	negative	equivalents,	while	preserving	the	norm	
of	the	quantum	state.	
This	approach	is	also	consistent	with	the	principles	of	quantum	field	theory	and	the	use	
of	Dirac	fields,	showing	that	the	application	of	a	variable	electromagnetic	potential	to	a	
beam	of	fermions	can	transform	them	into	negative-mass	antifermions.	This	process	
involves	coupling	the	creation	and	annihilation	operators	for	positive	and	negative	mass	
states,	providing	an	experimental	framework	for	exploring	the	fundamental	nature	of	
matter.	[1],[2],[3].	
This	transform	suggests	that	negative	energies	are	acceptable	if	they	are	associated	with

	Thus,	by	examining	the	Dirac	and	Feyman-	Stueckelberg	solutions	and	the	discrete	
symmetries	C	,	P	,	T	,	and	the	unitary	application	of	the	T	operator	and	the	anti-unitary	
application	of	the	P	operator	to	the	Dirac	equation	makes	it	possible	to	transform

involves	the	coupling	of	creation	and	annihilation	operators	for	positive	and	negative	
mass	states,	providing	an	experimental	framework	for	exploring	the	fundamental	nature	
of	matter.	Until	2011,	this	might	have	seemed	justified.	But	then	a	Nobel	Prize	was	
awarded	to	the	discoverers	of	the	accelerating	cosmic	expansion	([4],[5],[6]).	Now,	in	
Einstein's	field	equation,	such	a	phenomenon	can	be	interpreted	by	the	presence	of	a	
negative	pressure,	which	is	a	volume	density	of	energy.	The	study	of	negative	energy	
states	should	therefore	be	considered.	The	probability	of	existence	of	these	negative	
energy	states	is	  E / m	,	m	being	the	mass.	This	approach	would	therefore	imply	the	
introduction	of	negative	masses	into	the	cosmological	model.	This	has	been	the	subject	
of	articles	([7],[8]),	in	which	we	have	endeavoured	to	stick	to	observational	data.	
		3	–	Matter	in	dynamic	group	theory.		
	In	1970,	the	mathematician	J.M.Souriau	[10]	introduced	a	purely	geometric	definition	of	
the	physical	quantities	energy,	impulse	and	spin.	His	starting	point	was	the	isometry	
group	of	Minkowski	space.	A	first	subgroup	is	that	of	space-time	translations.			
	
(8)																																																																			
	The	second	subgroup	is	the	Lorentz	group.	Let	X	be	a	vector	of	the	Minkowski	space.	Let	
G	be	the	Gramm	matrix:		
	
(9)																																																									
The	length	of	the	vector	X	is:		
(10)																																																																										 Xt G X		
	Let's	look	for	a	group	that	preserves	this	length,	whose	element	is	represented	by	the	
matrix	L	that	acts	on	the	vector	X	according	to:		
	(11)																																																																											 X' = L X		
	The	conservation	of	vector	length	requires	that:		
	(12)																																												 Xt G X = X't G X' = (LX)tG LX = Xt(LtG L)X	
	Hence	the	axiomatic	definition	of	the	Lorentz	group:	
	(13)																																																																											 LtG L = G

	Combining	the	two	subgroups	gives	us	the	Poincaré	group,	the	isometry	group	of	the

	The	Poincaré	group	is	of	dimension	10.	Its	Lie	algebra	is	therefore	a	vector	space	of	the	
same	dimension.	The	group	can	be	made	to	act	on	its	Lie	algebra	:	
	(18)																																																																								 δg' = g−1δgg	
	This	gives	rise	to	what	Souriau	calls	the	moment	of	the	group,	as	a	dual	of	Lie	algebra.	
This	will	enable	us	to	construct	the	action	of	the	group	on	its	moment,	which	will	also	be	
of	dimension	10.	Let's	calculate	the	inverse	matrix	of	g.

To	the	nearest	second	order		:

We	thus	construct	the	action	of	the	Poincaré	group	on	its	space	of	moments.	If	we	
wanted	to	go	from	P'	to	P,	this	would	mean	using	the	inverse	of	the	group	element.	To

	What	is	the	physical	meaning	of	this	dynamic	group's	action?	Spatiotemporal	translation	
places	us	elsewhere	and	in	a	different	era.	The	Lorentz	group	can	be	considered	as	the	
group	of	four-dimensional	rotations	(to	which	symmetries	are	added).	It	conserves	the	
length	of	the	vector	P,	which	will	simply	be	the	energy-impulse	quadrivector		
(with	c	=	1):		
(53)																																																																	
		
This	conservation	will	result	in:		
(54)																																																																				 E2 − p2 = Cst		
	The	moment	had	ten	components.	One	for	energy,	three	for	impulse.	That	leaves	six,	
which	we're	going	to	arrange	into	an	antisymmetrical	matrix:		
	
	
(55)																																																					
	We	then	show	that	the	3-vector	f,	called	"passage"	by	Souriau,	can	be	cancelled	out	when	
we	accompany	the	particle	in	its	motion.	It	therefore	does	not	characterize	a	motion,	by	
identifying	the	nature	of	a	particle	with	the	type	of	motion	considered.	The	final	3-vector	
is	spin,	which	is	unquantified	and	emerges	as	a	purely	geometric	quantity..

	In	that	article,	we	were	in	pursuit	of	reality.	Here	we	have	Souriau's	illustration	of	the	
strategy	[10],	which	can	be	summed	up	as	follows:		
	-	We	give	ourselves	a	space,	with	its	metric	and	isometry	group.		
	-	We	write	the	coadjoint	action	of	this	group	on	the	dual	of	its	Lie	algebra,	of	the	
same	dimension	as	this	group.	
	-	The	components	of	this	moment	then	define	"a	physics",	one	whose	
"playground"	is	this	particular	space.		
	
To	illustrate	this	technique,	we'll	start	with	3D	Euclidean	space.	Its	metric	is:		
	(57)																																																														 ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2		
	Its	Gramm	matrix	is	then	the	unit	matrix	I4.	Its	isometry	group	is	the	Euclidean	group:		
	(58)																																																																						
⎠⎟		
	The	a	matrices	are	then	the	orthogonal	matrices,	defined	by:		
	(59)																																																																											 a t a = I		
	C	is	the	3D	translation	vector:

	Euclid's	group,	of	dimension	6,	can	be	considered	as	a	particular	dynamic	group,	that	of	
statics.	The	previous	calculation	can	be	repeated.	The	moment	is	then	composed	of	two	
3-vectors,	which	are	then	assimilated	to	a	force	and	a	torsional	moment.	The	
components	of	the	moment	allow	summations	to	be	made.	In	statics,	we	sum	forces	and	
torsional	moments;	in	dynamics,	energies,	impulses	and	spins.	In	3D,	what	"inhabits"	
Euclidean	space,	considered	as	related	to	statics,	are	states	of	stress	of	a	uniform,	infinite	
material.	In	4D,	these	are	classes	of	motion,	each	class	being	assimilated	to	a	type	of	
particle.	These	movements	are	inscribed	along	geodesics	of	Minkowski	space.	Non-zero-
length	particles	are	masses,	and	zero-length	particles	are	photons.

Euclid's	group	has	two	related	components.	A	property	inherited	from	its	subgroup,	that	
of	orthogonal	matrices,	depending	on	whether	the	space	is	inverted	or	not,	depending	
on	whether	we	are	considering	O(3)	or	SO(3)	groups.		
	
Let's	return	to	the	Poincaré	group.		
		4	–	Dynamic	groups	and	reality.		
	Hilbert	saw	mathematics	as	a	kind	of	lamp	illuminating	the	path	to	knowledge.	In	his	
resolutely	optimistic	attitude,	he	was	convinced	that,	faced	with	any	problem,	a	
mathematical	tool	would	always	emerge	that	would	enable	solutions	to	be	found,	even	if	
this	meant	acting	as	a	key	to	open	a	door	onto	a	new	realm	of	reality.		For	example,	when	
dynamic	group	theory	is	used	to	integrate	physical	quantities	into	a	geometric	context,	it	
suggests	an	extension	of	the	"playground"	with	new	objects.	The	Lorentz	group	has	four	
related	components.		
- 	The	elements	  Ln

}invert	time,	but	not	space.

By	grouping	the	first	two	elements,	we	form	:		
	
- The	orthochronous	group	  Lo{
},	also	known	
as	the	restricted	Lorentz	group.		
	
- The	antichronous	subset		
	The	Poincaré	group	inherits	these	properties	with	four	related	components.	The	
orthochronous	Poincaré	subgroup,	also	known	as	the	restricted	Poincaré	group,	was	the	
only	one	used	by	scientists.	But	what	to	do	with	its	antichronous	components?

		5	–	A	further	extension	of	dynamic	group	theory.		
	For	the	moment,	our	"real	world"	is	populated	only	by	photons	and	electrically	
uncharged	masses.	As	early	as	1915,	D.Hilbert	had	attempted	to	include	electromagnetic	
phenomena	in	a	geometric	formalism.	As	quantum	mechanics	had	not	yet	emerged,	nor	
had	high-energy	physics,	scientists	of	the	time	knew	only	two	forces:	the	gravitational	
force	and	the	electromagnetic	force.	In	1915	and	1916,	Hilbert	published	an	essay	
entitled	"Fundamentals	of	Physics".	In	the	first	version,	presented	on	November	20,	
1915	[25],	was	the	first	presentation	of	the	field	equation,	which	Einstein	presented	five	
days	later	[26],	in	the	same	journal.	By	mutual	agreement,	Einstein	was	given	the	credit	
for	what	was	to	become	the	foundation	of	general	relativity.	Here	is	Hilbert's	published	
field	equation:

Hilbert	designates	the	Ricci	tensor	and	scalar	as	 
Kµνand	 K.	In	Einstein's	equation,	
Einstein	places	the	Laue	scalar	T	in	the	second	member.	In	Einstein's	equation,	Einstein	
places	the	Laue	scalar	 T	in	the	second	member.	But	Einstein's	can	be	considered	the	
most	accomplished.	Right	up	to	his	death	in	1955,	Einstein	pursued	the	project	of	
integrating	gravitation	and	electromagnetism	into	a	single	field	equation,	without	
succeeding.	In	fact,	it's	impossible	with	only	4	dimensions.	This	extension	was	attempted	
in	1921	by	Theodor	Kaluza	[26]	and	in	1926	by	Oskar	Klein	[28].		The	complete	
calculation	was	given	by	J.M.Souriau	in	1964	[11].	This	is	a	little-known	work,	published	
exclusively	in	French.	This	work	includes	the	geometric	translation	of	matter-antimatter	
symmetry,	by	inversion	of	the	fifth	dimension.	Let's	extend	this	dimensional	context	to	a	
4D	space,	known	as	Kaluza	space,	where	the	fifth	dimension	ζ	is	space-like,	i.e.	where	
the	metric	becomes

If	we	look	for	the	isometry	group	of	such	a	space,	it	will	be	the	product	of	the	subgroup	
of	pentadimensional	translations:

	And	the	subgroup	that	could	be	called	"extended	Lorentz	group"	 Λ,	axiomatically	
defined	by:

	It	is	then	possible	to	reconcile	the	whole	calculus	of	moment,	given	that	the	number	of	
dimensions	is	not	explicitly	stated.	To	begin	with,	we	can	use	Noether's	theorem	to	say	
that,	if	there	is	a	one-parameter	subgroup	of	translations	along	an	additional	dimension,	
this	must	go	hand	in	hand	with	the	conservation	of	a	scalar	q,	which	we	will	then	
assimilate	to	the	electric	charge.	This	charge	will	constitute	an	eleventh	component	of	
the	moment	of	a	dynamical	group	of	dimension	11.	But	this	approach,	in	all	its	generality,	
would	break	the	constancy	of	the	electric	charge.	We	can	then	consider	only	one	
subgroup	of	this	extended	Lorentz	group:		
	(71)																																																									
	This	subgroup	acts	on	the	additional	scalar,	on	this	electric	charge	q,	in	only	two	ways.		
	-	It	preserves	this	electric	charge	q	
	-	It	inverts	it	
	
We	can	then	construct	a	subgroup	of	this	extension	of	the	complete	Poincaré	group	by	
combining	it	with	the	subgroup	of	pentadimensional	translations.:

necessarily	involve	a	revision	of	the	geometric	context,	since	the	general	relativity	
model	can	no	longer	account	for	observations.	There	are	two	ways	of	doing	this.	The	
first	consists	in	hypothesizing	the	existence	of	a	second	universe,	CPT	symmetrical	to	
our	own,	which	the	authors	then	situate	on	the	other	side	of	the	Big	Bang	[16].	More	
recently,	N.	Kumar	 [18]	envisaged	the	interaction	of	these	two	universes	by	
"entanglement",	and	showed	that	this	would	lead	to	an	acceleration	of	expansion	in	our	
own	universe.	T-symmetry	evokes	what	had	already	been	predicted	by	Andréi	Sakharov	
in	the	1960s	([19],	[20],	[21]).	The	didactic	2D	image	is	as	follows:	
	

	

	

	

Fig.3	:	Didactic	2D	image	of	the	Sakharov,	Boyle,	Finn,	Turok	and	Kumar	Model.	
	Another	way	of	looking	at	things	is	the	Janus	cosmological	model	([12],	[13],	[14],	[15],	
[16])	with	a	two-folds	cover	structure.:		
		

	

Fig.4	:	Didactic	2D	image	of	the	Janus	Cosmological	Model.

	Let's	move	on	to	the	M	component	of	the	moment.	We	have:

Tr ( M' L *ΩL) + P'* L *ΓC

The	term	 P * L * Ω Cis	the	scalar	product	of	two	(complex)	vectors.	There	is	the	row	
vector P *	and	the	column	vector L * Ω C.		So	I	can	write	:

	And	perform	another	circular	permutation		:

Which	gives	me:		
Tr( LM'L *Ω) + Tr( C P *L * Ω )

I	reverse	the	‘	:

	The	physical	interpretation	of	this	section	remains	to	be	written..		
		9	–	Conclusion.		
	What	is	perhaps	most	interesting	in	the	overview	we	have	just	given	is	the	fact	that	
inversions	of	energy	and	mass	appear	in	both	quantum	field	theory	and	dynamical	
group	theory.	An	approach	which,	through	the	cosmological	Janus	model,	finds	its	
answer	in	differential	geometry.	A	geometric	interpretation	of	quantum	charges	and	
matter-antimatter	symmetry	is	also	suggested.	Finally,	we	explore	aspects	of	an	
extension	into	the	complex	field.
