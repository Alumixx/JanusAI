Abstract	:	It	is	shown,	in	the	framework	of	the	Janus	cosmological	model,	that	the	object	
responsible	for	the	phenomenon	called	dipole	repeller	is	a	spheroidal	cluster	made	
exclusively	of	anti-hydrogen	and	anti-helium	of	negative	mass.	Emitting	photons	of	
negative	energy,	this	object	is	not	observable	with	optical	instruments,	but	attenuates		
constitute	the	essential	content	of	the	world	of	negative	masses	which	contains	neither	
galaxies,	nor	stars,	nor	heavy	elements,	nor	planets,	nor	biomolecules.	Life	is	therefore	
absent.

	1	‚Äì	Introduction		
In	2017	Yehudi	Hoffman,	B.	Tully,	H.Courtois	and	D.Pomar√®de	published	the	first	very	
large	scale	map	of	the	universe	[1],	based	not	only	on	the	position	of	galaxies,	but	also	
including	the	velocity	field,	subtracting	the	Hubble	field	from	what	emanated	from	the	
raw	measurements	of	their	redshift.	The	result	is	extremely	impressive	and	will	be,	we	
believe,	one	of	the	major	discoveries	of	observational	cosmology	today,	comparable	to	
that	made	by	Edwin	Hubble	a	century	earlier.	It	was	already	known	that	the	motions	of	a	
certain	set	of	galaxies	reflected	a	convergence	toward	a	formation	that	had	been	given	
the	name	of	Great	Attractor.	The	analysis	published	in	2017	highlighted	the	action	of	
another,	larger	formation,	located	beyond	this	one,	to	which	the	name	Shapley	Attractor	
was	given.	But	the	most	singular	result	was	to	highlight	a	region,	roughly	diametrically	
opposed	to	these	two	formations,	where	no	galaxies	were	found,	only	a	large	void	
around	which	the	neighboring	galaxies	presented	a	flight	motion,	centered	on	this	object.	
This	formation	was	first	given	the	name	of	dipole	repeller.	Then,	deciding	to	couple	it	to	
the	attractive	formations,	it	was	included	in	the	name	of	Dipole	Attractor.	There	is	no	
doubt	that	the	understanding	of	such	a	phenomenon,	which	cannot	be	qualified	as	an	
artifact,	will	require	an	important	progress	in	our	understanding	of	cosmic	dynamics.

2	‚Äì	Some	attempts	at	interpretation.			
Four	years	after	this	discovery,	few	attempts	have	been	made	to	model	this	
phenomenon.	The	article	in	reference	[2]	does	not	focus	on	this	question	of	the	dipole	
repeller	which	follows	from	the	hypotheses	made.	It	is	known	that	observations	have	
highlighted	a	phenomenon	of	acceleration	of	the	cosmic	expansion	([3],	[4],	[5]).	This	
implies	the	action	of	a	component	associated	with	a	negative	pressure.	One	of	the	
models	considered	is	to	suppose	the	existence,	within	the	cosmos,	of	elements	of	
negative	mass,	which	would	then	exert	a	repulsive	action	on	the	components	of	positive	
mass.	This	hypothesis	is	at	the	center	of	the	works	corresponding	to	the	references	([6],	
[7],	[8],	[9],	[10],	[11]).		In	reference	[2]	the	author	makes	numerous	hypotheses	in	
different	fields,	on	the	nature	of	the	Big	Bang,	the	quantum	vacuum,	the	origin	of	the	
universe	"which	would	have	been	created	by	the	gravitational	collapse	of	an	
antineutrino	star".	To	the	point	that	he	recalls	that	the	conclusions	of	his	article	remain	
speculative.		Among	these	hypotheses	is	that	antimatter	would	have	a	negative	
gravitational	mass,	which	would	allow,	according	to	him,	"the	progressive	formation	of	
neutrino	stars	and	stars	made	up	of	antineutrinos	which	would	repel	each	other".	This	
repulsive	aspect	of	a	primordial	antimatter	is	also	mentioned	in	reference	[12],	but	
without	further	justification.	All	these	people	are	waiting	for	the	result	of	the	analysis	of	
the	behavior	of	the	antimatter	created	in	the	LHC,	slowed	down	and	subjected	to	the	
earth	gravitational	field	[13],	aspects	discussed	in	[14].		This	is	a	question	that	we	will	
address	later.	In	[15]	the	author	evokes	the	situation	of	Laniakea,	pushed	by	the	dipole	
repeller	and	pulled	by	the	Shapley	Attractor.	Here	again,	a	repulsion	between	matter	and	
antimatter	is	evoked,	which	would	have	given	rise	to	the	present	large-scale	structure	of	
the	universe,	organized	around	large	voids.	But	we	do	not	find	any	real	model	of	the	
object	that	would	be	located	at	the	center	of	this	great	void,	nor	why	we	would	not	
receive	any	light	signal	from	it.	In	[16]	the	author	appeals	to	a	hypothetical	5th	force.	In	
[17]	through	numerical	simulations	we	reconstruct	the	ad	hoc	distribution	of	dark	
matter	consistent	with	the	observational	data	of	[1].	From	this	exploration	we	retain	
two	explanatory	schemes.	That	of	the	existence	of	hypothetical	objects	made	of	
repulsive	antimatter,	unobservable	and	that	of	a	gap	in	the	dark	matter	distribution.		
	3	‚Äì	About	the	interpretation	through	a	gap	in	the	dark	matter.	
One	is	entitled	to	ask	the	question:	can	a	gap	in	the	dark	matter	produce	the	observed	
repulsion	effect?	Conceptually	one	is	then	tempted	to	start	by	considering	a	spherical	
gap	in	a	uniform	dark	matter	distribution.	We	then	think	that	this	system	should	obey	
the	Poisson	equation.		
(1)																																																				
= 4œÄG œÅdm		
This	equation	is	linear.	We	can	therefore	say	that	by	superimposing	two	given	density	
distributions	 œÅ1	and	 œÅ2,	the	resulting	gravitational	potential	is	the	sum	of	the	potentials	
associated	with	these	two	distributions	 Œ® = Œ®1 + Œ®2.

This	solution	is	:		
(3)																															  
We	thus	obtain	a	repulsive	gravitational	field,	proportional	to	the	distance	to	the	center	
of	the	sphere.	It	remains	to	calculate	the	gravitational	field	created	by	the	uniform	
distribution,	still	considering	the	Poisson	equation	(1).	Its	solution	is	then:		
(4)																													  
We	obtain	the	same	force	field,	of	opposite	sign.	Consequently,	by	superimposing,	inside	
the	gap	the	gravitational	field	is	null:

(5)																																																															  
In	any	case	the	solution	(4),	of	the	Poisson	equation,	corresponding	to	a	uniform	
distribution	is	a	paradox.	We	have	placed	ourselves	in	a	stationary	or	quasi-stationary	
unif.	Then,	whatever	the	point	
situation,	considering	a	uniform	distribution	of	density	 œÅdm
chosen	as	the	origin	of	the	coordinates,	we	find	a	non-zero	gravitational	field	  
!g,	whose	
modulus	increases	proportionally	to	the	distance	to	this	point.	We	are	faced	with	a	
paradox.	
We	are	forced	to	go	back	to	the	construction	of	this	Poisson	equation.	Unlike	
electromagnetism,	this	equation	cannot	be	constructed	by	calculating	the	flow	of	the	
gravitational	field	through	a	closed	surface,	because	of	the	non	nullity	at	infinity.	In	
gravitation	we	will	be	forced	to	consider	the	Poisson	equation	as	the	linearized	version	
of	Einstein's	equation	in	a	very	restrictive	case:	in	a	stationary	(or	quasi-stationary)	
situation	and	when	we	can	describe	the	metric	as	a	perturbation	of	a	Lorentz	metric	:

	The	gravitational	potential	is	thus	defined	by:		
Œµ Œ≥ 00		
(8)																																																																					 
and	equation	(7)	is	then	identified	with	the	Poisson	equation.	But,	in	this	approach,	it	
should	be	noted	that	everything	is	based	on	the	fact	that	we	can	consider	a	stationary	
metric	solution,	in	the	zero	order,	expressed	in	the	form	of	a	Lorentz	metric	,	
immediately	associated	to	a	portion	of	empty	space.		In	the	above,	the	perturbation	of	
the	metric	is	due	to	a	density	of	finite	extension.	It	is	not	possible	to	reconcile	this	
approach	on	the	basis	of	a	non-empty,	uniform	and	infinite	density	of	order	zero.		The	
conclusion	is	that	it	is	simply	impossible	to	define	a	gravitational	potential	in	a	uniform	
matter	distribution.	One	can	consider	that	this	remark	is	of	little	interest.	It	remains	that	
this	question	had	never	been	raised	before.		However,	the	problem	of	the	existence	of	
large	voids	in	the	large	scale	structure	of	the	universe	is	not	solved.	Indeed,	the	
gravitational	instability	produces	clusters,	not	vacuums,	so	that	we	do	not	have	a	
scheme	for	their	formation.		
		4	‚Äì	The	dipole	repeller	in	the	Janus	cosmological	model.		
	This	translates	into	an	introduction	of	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	model	that	
satisfies	the	equivalence	principle.	This	is	impossible	in	the	framework	of	classical	
general	relativity,	based	on	a	single	field	equation,	that	of	Einstein,	with	or	without	its	
cosmological	constant:		
	
R g¬µŒΩ + Œõg¬µŒΩ = œáT¬µŒΩ																																																																			
(9)																																																							 
	Indeed	the	control	particles,	positive	or	negative,	follow	the	same	geodesics,	whatever	
the	source	of	the	field.	As	a	consequence,	we	get	the	following	interaction	scheme:		
	-	The	positive	masses	attract	the	positive	and	negative	masses.		
	-	The	negative	masses	repel	the	positive	and	negative	masses.		
	
This	leads	to	the	runaway	paradox	(see	Fig.	1),	according	to	which	a	couple	constituted	
by	masses	of	opposite	signs	accelerates	uniformly	while	keeping	a	constant	kinetic	
energy.

Fig.1	:	The	runaway	paradox	

	
	When	the	authors	[2],	[12],	[13]	mention	the	existence	of	negative	mass	structures,	
these	aspects	are	not	considered,	although	they	are	fundamental.		It	is	not	possible	to	
invoke	the	presence	of	negative	masses	without	clarifying	this	point.	In	[18]	the	author	
justifies	what	he	calls	himself	a	"toy	model"	by	saying	that	this	runaway	effect	could	be	
the	source	of	cosmic	rays.	To	remain	within	the	framework	of	a	description	using	a	
single	field	equation,	he	is	forced	to	invoke	a	hypothetical	mechanism	of	continuous	
creation	of	negative	mass	so	that	this	leads	to	the	constancy	of	its	value	over	time,	which	
would	then	constitute	an	interpretation	of	the	presence	of	the	cosmological	constant	in	
the	equation.		But	this	scheme	does	not	exclude	the	runway	phenomenon	which	he	then	
considers	as	the	source	of	the	existence	of	particles	of	very	high	energy,	so-called	cosmic	
rays.	Because	of	this	undescribed	mechanism	of	constant	creation	of	negative	mass	the	
author	only	obscures	the	situation	even	more.		
The	Janus	cosmological	model	([6],	[7],	[8],	[9],	[10],	[11])	takes	up	the	idea	of	a	bimetric	
description	of	the	universe,	initiated	in	[19],	then	taken	up	in	([20],[21]).	If	the	
description	[19]	corresponds	to	branes	whose	points	are	connected	by	a	hypothetical	
force	field,	the	description	([20],[21])	is	clearer	and	more	constructed,	geometrically.	
The	system	of	the	two	field	equations	resulting	from	their	construction,	from	a	
Lagrangian,	satisfies	the	Bianchi	conditions.	The	universe	is	then	an	M4	manifold	
equipped	with	two	metrics,	the	first	one	producing	the	geodesics	along	which	the	
positive	masses	and	the	positive	energy	photons	move	and	the	second	one	the	geodesics	
along	which	the	negative	mass	particles	and	the	negative	energy	photons	move.	The	
disjoint	character	of	these	two	systems	of	geodesics	leads	to	the	fact	that	each	set	of	
masses	interacts	with	the	other	only	through	an	antigravity	force	and	that	the	negative	
masses	are	therefore	invisible	for	an	observer	constituted	of	positive	masses.	The	model	
([20],	[21])	was	created	in	2006-2008	at	a	time	when	the	phenomenon	of	accelerating	
cosmic	expansion	was	not	recognized.	In	an	effort	to	fit	with	what	she	considers	as	the	
standard	model	(of	Friedmann)	the	author	makes	choices	of	signs	which	lead	to	a	non-
satisfaction	of	the	principle	of	equivalence	for	the	negative	masses,	which	are	then	
endowed	with	a	negative	gravitational	mass,	but	a	positive	inertial	mass.	In	the	Janus	
model,	on	the	contrary,	we	try	to	satisfy	the	equivalence	principle	within	the	two	
populations,	which	leads	to	the	system	of	equations:

These	geometrical	conditions	are	only	problematic	in	regions	where	the	densities	of	
matter,	of	positive	or	negative	mass,	are	non-zero.	By	explaining	these	conditions,	in	the	
conditions	of	the	Newtonian	approximation	they	simply	translate	the	fact	that	inside	
these	masses,	where	the	density	is	assumed	to	be	constant,	the	pressure	force	balances	
the	gravity	force.		
Outside	these	regions	it	is	the	vacuum.	The	second	members	are	zero	and	the	Bianchi	
conditions	are	satisfied	identically	because	of	the	form	of	the	first	members,	themselves	
resulting	from	the	presence	of	the	terms	 R(+) ‚àíg(+)	and	 R(‚àí) ‚àíg(‚àí)	in	action	as	first	
introduced	in	[19].	The	Janus	model	is	based	on	a	set	of	agreements	with	observation.	
What	interests	us	here	is	a	possible	justification	of	the	Great	Repeller	phenomenon.	In	
its	Newtonian	approximation	the	system	of	the	two	coupled	field	equations	leads	to	the	
following	interaction	laws:	 
-	Masses	of	the	same	sign	attract	each	other	according	to	Newton's	law	
-	Masses	of	opposite	signs	repel	each	other	according	to	"anti-Newton".		
The	runaway	phenomenon	is	thus	eliminated	and	the	principle	of	equivalence	is	
satisfied	in	both	populations.	For	negative	masses,	their	gravitational	masses	and	their	
inertial	masses	are	negative	and	equal.	It	is	then	possible	to	do	numerical	simulations.	If	

	
7	
the	absolute	values	of	the	two	densities œÅ(+) > 0	and	 œÅ(‚àí) < 0	the	values	of	the	thermal	
agitation	velocities	 <V(+) > = <V(‚àí) >	are	equal	we	obtain	a	percolation,	which	does	not	
fit	with	the	observational	data	referring	to	the	large	scale	structure	of	the	universe	(see	
Fig.	2). 

 

Fig.2	:	Evolution	of	the	system	when	  œÅ(‚àí) = œÅ(+)

	On	the	other	hand,	if	we	assume	that	there	is	a	strong	dissymmetry	between	the	two	
populations,	so	that	  œÅ(‚àí) >> œÅ(+)	then	the	pattern	changes	completely.	As	the	Jeans	
times	vary	as	the	inverse	of	the	square	root	of	the	density,	the	negative	masses	are	
shorter.	These	then	form	a	regular	network	of	spheroidal	conglomerates.	The	positive	
mass	is	forced	to	occupy	the	remaining	space,	which	gives	it	a	lacunar	structure	[22]	
comparable	to	a	set	of	joined	bubbles	(see	Fig.	3),	a	pattern	repeated	in	[18].

Teams	with	adequate	means	will	easily	extend	this	to	3D.	As	developed	in	[6]	and	[10]	as	
well	as	in	[11]	the	negative	mass	content	accounts	for	both	the	dark	matter	and	the	dark	
energy,	which	is	identified	with	the	contribution	  œÅ(‚àí) c(‚àí)2 < 0	and	
is	therefore	
responsible	for	the	acceleration	of	the	expansion	of	positive	masses.	According	to	this	
model	the	phenomenon	of	the	dipole	repeller	translates	the	presence,	within	this	great	
void,	of	a	spheroidal	conglomerate	of	negative	mass,	invisible,	because	it	emits	photons	
of	negative	energy	that	our	eyes	and	our	measuring	instruments	cannot	capture. 
	5	‚Äì	Nature	of	the	objects	of	negative	masses 
This	question	has	been	examined	in	[6]	and	the	detailed	calculations	can	be	found	in	
[11].	In	the	theory	of	dynamical	groups	[24]	the	link	between	geometric	structure	and	
content	is	translated	by	the	nature	of	the	associated	dynamical	group.	The	General	
Relativity	goes	with	the	restricted	Poincar√©	group,	where	we	keep	only	the	set	of	terms	
which	do	not	reverse	time.	It	is	thus	the	orthochron	subgroup	of	the	complete	Poincar√©	
group,	built	from	the	orthochron	Lorentz	subgroup.	Here	after	its	matrix	representation:

group	act	on	the	dual	of	its	Lie	algebra,	or	momentum	space,	one	makes	appear	the

The	action	on	the	momentum	space	adds	to	the	particle	n	quantum	numbers	qi	,	
including	the	electric	charge,	which	are	all	constants.	By	introducing	the	group:	 
(14)																																						 
			we	translate	geometrically	the	concept	of	antimatter,	the	inversion	of	quantum	charges	
(C-symmetry)	going	hand	in	hand	with	the	inversion	of	movements	in	additional	
dimensions.	 
If	we	want	to	introduce	negative	energies,	it	is	enough	to	pass	from	the	restricted	
Poincar√©	group	Lo	,	orthochronic,	to	the	full	group		 Œª L o with Œª = ¬± 1	.		Immediately	we	
find	that	the	time-inversion	  ( Œª = ‚àí 1)	goes	with	energy	and	mass-inversion.	The	
corresponding	dynamic	group	is		[6]			:

In	this	model	the	C-symmetry	exists	both	in	the	world	of	positive	and	negative	masses.	
There	are	thus	two	antimatter.		
-	The	first	one,	C-symmetric	 ( Œª = 1; ¬µ = ‚àí1)	of	the	ordinary	matter,	of	positive	mass 
-	The	second,	PT-symmetric	 ( Œª = ‚àí1; ¬µ = 1)of	ordinary	matter,	of	negative	mass.	 
It	is	the	first	one	that	we	make	appear	in	laboratory.	The	model	therefore	predicts	that	
this	one	will	behave	like	ordinary	matter	in	the	earth's	gravity	field.

	6	‚Äì	About	the	lack	of	observation	of	primordial	antimatter.	 
If	we	suppose,	as	A.Sakharov	([25],[26],	[27]),	that	the	couple	:		
-	Matter	of	positive	mass	
-	Antimatter	of	positive	mass	
is	formed	from	quarks	and	antiquarks	of	positive	energy,	and	that	a	couple	:	
-	Matter	of	negative	mass	
-	Antimatter	of	negative	mass	
was	formed	from	quarks	and	antiquarks	of	negative	energy,	and	that	in	addition	the	
synthesis	of	the	matter	of	positive	mass,	in	the	first	couple,	was	faster,	whereas	it	is	that	
of	the	antimatter	of	negative	mass,	in	the	second	couple	which	was	it	one	leads	on	the	
idea	that	the	objects,	in	the	center	of	the	great	voids	of	the	large-scale	structure	of	the	
universe,	whose	presence	is	betrayed	by	the	phenomenon	of	the	dipole	repeller,	would	
be	constituted	of	antimatter,	that	is	to	say	of	antiprotons,	anti-neutrons	and	anti-
electrons	of	negative	mass.	These	would	then	form	spheroidal	objects	made	of	anti-
hydrogen	(light	elements)	of	negative	mass	comparable	to	immense	protostars	with	a	
cooling	time	superior	to	the	age	of	the	universe,	which	could	not	be	the	seat	of	fusion	
reaction,	thus	generating	neither	stars,	nor	galaxies,	nor	planets.	 
	7	‚Äì	Observations	specifically	related	to	these	objects.	 
As	presented	in	[23]	these	negative	mass	objects	decrease	the	luminosity	of	the	
background	sources	by	negative	lensing.	But	the	luminosities	of	galaxies	at	z	>	7	are	
indeed	weak.	The	classical	approach	is	to	consider	them	as	dwarfs.	But	these	could	be	
galaxies	of	normal	size	and	mass,	so	the	luminosity	would	be	affected	by	this	
phenomenon.	Finer	measurements,	in	large	voids,	could	reveal	a	threshold	that	would	
allow	access	to	the	diameter	of	these	formations. 
	8	‚Äì	Conclusion.	 
We	have	examined	the	very	few	attempts	to	model	the	dipole	repeller	phenomenon,.	
Then	we	have	moved	on	to	the	interpretation	of	the	Janus	cosmological	model.	We	recall	
the	origin	and	the	essential	aspects	of	this	model,	based	on	the	hypothesis	that	the	
universe	has	a	content	of	negative	masses,	such	that	the	principle	of	equivalence	is	
satisfied	in	both	populations	and	that	eliminates	the	runaway	phenomenon	and	
produces	the	same	effects	attributed	so	far	to	dark	matter	and	dark	energy.	In	this	
model	the	dominant	negative	mass	forms	a	regular	set	of	spheroidal	clusters,	which

repel	the	positive	mass	by	confining	it	in	the	residual	space,	giving	it	a	lacunar	structure.	
One	of	these	can	then	produce	the	phenomenon	of	dipole	repeller.
