Results presented below, show the standardized distance
modulus, linked to experimental parameters through the
relation :

µ = m∗

B − MB + αX1 − βC

where m∗
B is the observed peak magnitude in rest frame
B band, X1 is the time stretching of the light curve and
C the supernova color at maximum brightness.
Both MB , α and β are nuisance parameters in the dis-
tance estimate.
We took the values given in ref.[20] corresponding to the
best ﬁt of the whole set of combined data (740 super-
novae) with ΛCDM model.

With our best ﬁt, we have :χ2/d.o.f. = 657/738

(740 points and 2 parameters).
The corresponding curves are shown in ﬁg. 3, 4, 5, 6,
in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The
comparison with both model best ﬁts are shown in ﬁg. 7.

We can derive the age of the universe (see annex B)
with respect to q0 and H0 and some numerical values are
given in table I, for diﬀerent (q0, H0) values. For our best

WHAT IS MISSING

Lets ﬁgure out that, when extended to the early age
of the universe, the JCM proposes an alternative to the

An exact solution of the system (1) for the dust
era of the universe, was presented in Astrophysics and

the bolometric magnitude versus redshift ﬁts pretty well

For sake of simplicity, we will now write a(+) ≡ a.

ture of the universe we supposed that the mass density
of the negative species (negative mass ’twin’ matter) is
much higher that the one of the positive species.
In JCM, we have to take into account two systems, each
owing their own sets of variable constants plus space and
time scale factors :

[c(+), G(+), h(+), m(+), e(+), a(+), t(+)]
[c(−), G(−), h(−), m(−), e(−), a(−), t(−)]

A future work will show how, the system of coupled
ﬁeld equations(1) including a variable constants process,
starting from a fully symmetrical initial situation can ex-
plain density instabilities.
Moreover, when the densities get weaker, the sets :

[c(+), G(+), h(+), m(+), e(+)]
[c(−), G(−), h(−), m(−), e(−)]

The ΛCDM model provides an interpretation of the ﬂuc-
tuations of the CMB. If the JCM wants to pretend to
challenge the ΛCDM it must provide an alternative in-
terpretation of such observational data.
This is out of the scope of the present paper and will the

1988[21], extended in 1995[7], and implies a variable con-

Based on a new geometrical framework the JCM mod-

ative energy and negative mass, if any. By developping
former Sakharovs theory, it explains the lack of primeval
antimatter observation. The negative sector is then com-
posed with negative mass protons, neutrons, electrons
and so on. Through such a negative energy, photons
make all negative sectors species invisible to us.
JCM model is explaining the strong gravitational lensing
eﬀects around galaxies and clusters of galaxies, due to the
surrounding and conﬁning negative mass environment. It
brings a model for VLS formation, spiral structure and
gives an explanation to the repellent phenomena recently
observed in a very large size mapping. It also explains
the ﬂatness of the rotation curves of galaxies.
The extension of JCM to a variable constants regime,
applying to the early stage, explains the homogeneity of
the early universe.
It brings an exact solution in the dust era, which takes
takes into account the acceleration of the universe. This
paper is willing to demonstrate the good agreement of
this solution with a single free parameter, with the ex-
perimental data on supernovae. The deceleration param-
eter q0, allways negative, happened to be small and there
is no need in JCM to introduce a non zero cosmological
constant to ﬁt the so far available data.
It is also pointed out that the model must now provide
its own interpretation of additional features like the CMB
ﬂuctuations.

Annex A : Bolometric magnitude

Starting from the cosmological equations correspond-
ing to positive species and neglectible pressure (dust uni-
verse) establish in ref.[8] :

(9)
with E ≡ a(+) 3ρ(+) +a(−) 3ρ(−) = constant < 0. For the
sake of simplicity we will write a ≡ a(+) in the following.
A parametric solution of Eq. (9) can be written as :

E = 0

(cid:18)

α2 = − 8πG

(11)
This solution imposes k = −1. Writing the usual deﬁni-
tions:

we can write :

In terms of the time t used in the FRLW metric, the
light emitted by Ge at time te is observed on G0 at a
time t0 (te > t0) and the distance l travelled by photons
(ds2 = 0) is related to the time diﬀerence t and then to
the u parameter through the relation :

l =

c dt
a(t)

=

(1 + ch(2 u)

ch2(u)

du = 2 u0 − 2 ue

(15)

t0(cid:90)

te

u0(cid:90)

We can also relate the distance l to the distance marker
r by (using Friedman's metric with k = −1) :

t0(cid:90)

te

r(cid:90)

0

l =

c dt
a(t)

=

dr(cid:48)√
1 + r(cid:48)2

= argsh(r)

(16)

So we can write :

r = sh(2 u0 − 2 ue) = 2 sh(u0 − ue) ch(u0 − ue) (17)
We need now to link ue and u0 to observable quantities
q0, H0, and z. From Eq. (10) we get :

and so :

(cid:18)(cid:114) a

u = argch

This relation rewrites as [23]:

(cid:21)

which is valid for q0 = 0.

Annex B : Age of the universe

Below we will establish the relation between the age of
the universe T0 with q0 and H0. This age is deﬁned by :

(cid:18) sh(2u0)

(cid:19)

T0 =

From Eq. (11), (13), (14) we get :

This relation is shown in ﬁg. 8.

Eq. (15) gives the usual redshift expression :

From Eq. (13) and (18) we get :

From Eq. (13), (18)) and (19)) we get :

ue = argch

= argsh

− 1 + 2q0z
2q0(1 + z)

(21)

Inserting Eq. (20) and (21) into Eq. (17), after a 'few'
technical manipulations, using at the end Eq.(14) and
considering the constraint that 1 + 2q0z > 0, we get :

q0z + (1 − q0)(cid:0)1 − √

1 + 2q0z(cid:1)

r =

q2
0(1 + z)

(22)

Which is similar to Mattig’s work [22] with usual Fried-
mann solutions where q0 > 0, here we have always q0 < 0.

The total energy received per unit area and unit
time interval measured by bolometers is related to the
luminosity :

Ebol =

4πa2

0r2(1 + z)2

(23)

Using Eq. (22), the bolometric magnitude can therefore
be written as :

q0z + (1 − q0)(cid:0)1 − √
