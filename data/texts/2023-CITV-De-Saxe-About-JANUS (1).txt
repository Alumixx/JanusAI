Abstract

In this work, we discuss the JANUS model in the context of the Galilean mechanics,
consider a covering of the space-time with two disjoint sheets corresponding respectively
to the negative and positive mass sectors. The space-time is equipped with a single metric
and connection representing the gravitation of which the sources are obtained by push-
forwarding the flux of both positive and negative masses onto the space-time. The asym-
metry between both sectors regarding Coriolis’ force is a means to know in which sector
we are living.

Introduction

In this work, we discuss the JANUS model [6] in the context of the Galilean mechanics. To
avoid the runaway effect, we build a model for which the masses of the same sign attract each
other according to Newton’s law, while masses of opposite signs repel each other according to
anti-Newton’s law.

Negative masses are positive masses that go back in time. The keystone idea is to consider
a covering of the space-time with two disjoint sheets corresponding respectively to the negative
and positive mass sectors. However, unlike JANUS model [6], we need on the space-time a
single metric and connection representing the gravitation of which the sources are obtained by
push-forwarding the flux of both positive and negative masses onto the space-time.

According to ´Elie Cartan’s idea, the motion of a free falling particle (test-particle) is such
that its linear 4-momentum is parallel-transported. At the classical limit of weak fields, we
recover Newton’s law and anti Newton’s law.

The negative and positive masses are living within two disjoint sectors. The photons travel
at the same velocity (to respect the causality principle) in distinct sectors, so negative masses
are not visible from the positive mass sector and conversely. The unique interaction between
positive and negative masses is in the space-time through the gravitation.

This approach is a milestone to build a relativistic cosmological model able to explain,

amongst other puzzling experimental observations, the existence of dark matter.

2 Galilean Mechanics

Before we go any further, we can verify our ideas at the approximation of weak fields. For
this aim, we use the theoretical framework of asymptotic expansion of general relativity with
Galilean covariance proposed in [4]. To begin with, we recall some basic concepts of this
approach.
The space-time will be consider as a differential manifold M of dimension 4. A point
X ∈ M represents an event. The 4-column vector of its coordinates (X α)0≤α≤3 in a chosen
local chart will be denoted X, X 0 = t being the time and X i = xi for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 being the
spatial coordinates, so we can write

In the sequel, the intrinsic, coordinate-free objects are denoted by a capital letter while their
representations in local charts are denoted by a normal letter. Let V (resp. V ′) the components
−→
V in a local chart X (resp. X′). The affine transformations V ′ = P V + V0,
of a tangent vector
where P ∈ GL(4) and V0 ∈ R4, preserving the distances, the time durations, the uniform
straight motions and the oriented volumes are called Galilean transformations. In what follows,
we are only interested by the linear ones

(1)

where u ∈ R3 is the velocity of transport, or Galilean boost, and R ∈ SO(3) is a spatial rotation.
The set of all these transformations is a Lie subgroup GAL of the affine group GA (4) called
Galilei group. The Lie subgroup of the linear Galilean transformations (1) is denoted GAL0.
∂X of a coor-
dinate change X (cid:55)→ X′ being a linear Galilean transformation is that this change is compound
of a rigid body motion and a clock change:

Theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition for the Jacobian matrix P = ∂X′

x′ = (R (t))T (x − x0 (t)),

t′ = t + t0

(2)
where t (cid:55)→ R (t) ∈ SO(3) and t (cid:55)→ x0(t) ∈ R3 are smooth mappings, and t0 ∈ R is a constant.
Then the velocity of transport is given by u = ω (t) × (x − x0 (t)) + ˙x0 (t) where ω is Poisson’s
vector such that:

˙R = j (ω) R (where for two vectors u and v, j (u) v = u × v).

For the proof, the reader is referred to ([3], p. 339-341, Theorem 16.4).

The relation between local charts:
X ∼ X′ ⇔ X and X′ are deduced one from each other by a transition map (2)
is an equivalence relation. An equivalence class under ∼ is called a Galilean atlas and its
elements are called Galilean charts or Galilean coordinate systems or Galilean reference frames.
In a physical point of view, the importance of these charts lies in the fact that they are the
coordinate systems in which the observers measure the durations and distances.

3 Bi-matter space-time as a covering
To modelize the existence of two species of mater, we introduce a covering π : C (cid:55)→ M of
the space-time with two disjoint sheets M+ and M− called sectors, each of which populated
with particles with mass (baryons, leptons) or without mass (photons). These two populations
do not interact directly. In particular, photons emitted by particles of one sector cannot be

Figure 1: Bi-matter covering

received by particles of the other sector. The only interaction between massive particles of
different sectors is through the gravitation, i.e. a connection that equips the space-time M.

We claim that (Figure 1):
• M, M+ and M− are equipped respectively with Galilean atlases A, A+ and A−.
• For every event X of the space-time, let X+ (resp. X−) the event of M+ (resp. M−)
such that π(X+) = X (resp. π(X−) = X). For every local chart X of A, there exists a
local chart ¯X of A+ such that the projection π is represented in the local charts X and
¯X by

t = ¯t,

x = ¯x

X and ¯X will be called twin local charts of M and M+. If there is no confusion, the
coordinates in the positive sector will be denoted latter on without bar and the projection
π will be locally represented by the identity map. Likewise, for every local chart X of
A, there exists a local chart ˜X of A− such that the projection π is represented in the
local charts X and ˜X by the T-reversal PT
t = −˜t,

x = ˜x

X and ˜X will be called twin local charts of M and M−.

4 Gravitation field equations

The particles of both sectors do not interact directly, but the space-time is the theater of
operations where they interact through the gravitation.

5 Equations of motion

In General Relativity, the gravitation is a connection. Let us consider its classical version. A
covariant differential or connection of a vector field is ∇V α = dV α + Γα
β (dX) V β where, using
Christoffel symbols, the elements of the connection matrix Γ are Γα
At each group of transformation is associated a family of connections and the corresponding
geometry. We call Galilean connections the symmetric connections on the tangent bundle TM
associated to Galilei group [8, 9, 5]. In a Galilean chart, the connection matrix is valued in the
Lie algebra gal0 of GAL0 [2, 3]. In absence of Coriolis’ effect, we have

then, according to the decomposition of the gravity (4),

hence the particle of the positive sector is attracted by particles of the same sector (Newton’s
law) and repelled by particles of the other one (anti Newton’s law).

then, according to the decomposition of the gravity (4),

hence the particle of the negative sector is attracted by particles of the same sector and repelled
by particles of the other one.

At the classical limit of weak fields, whatever the sector, the law of conservation of the

4-momentum allows to recover Newton’s and anti-Newton’s law.

6 The asymmetry between both sectors, a means to know

in which sector we are living

Up to now, we have considered the simplest situations in which only occurs the universal
gravitation interaction. Now it is time for a new actor to burst in on the scene, Coriolis’ force.
The most general form of a Galilean connection is [3]

(cid:18) 0

Γ =

j (Ω) d x − g d t

0
j (Ω) d t

(cid:19)

where Ω is a 3-column vector associated by the mapping j−1 to the skew-symmetric matrix, the
elements of which being Ωi
j0. The spinning vector Ω can be interpreted as representing
Coriolis’ effects [7, 3]. In a Galilean chart, this equation itemizes

j = Γi

˙m = 0,

˙p = m (g − Ω × v) − Ω × p = 0

(12)

In the positive sector, (9) leads to the equation of motion
m+ ˙v = m+(g − 2 Ω × v)

then a particle of the positive sector is sensitive to Coriolis’ force represented by the last term.

In the negative sector, owing to (10) the equation of motion

m− ˙v = −m−g

is identical to (11), then a particle of the negative sector is insensitive to Coriolis’ effect. This
reveals the asymmetry between both sectors concerning the spinning. As, according to what
the observations show, our mater is sensitive to Coriolis’ effect, showing that we are living in
the positive sector.
