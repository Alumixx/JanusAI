Introduction and main idea of this article.

Key   words : Non contractible hypersurface. Throat sphere, space bridge. Spherically
symmetric solution.

Abstract : Spherical symmetry does not immediately mean central symmetry. The time
independent, spherically symmetric solution of the homogeneous Einstein equation is
revisited with coordinates which keep the signature invariant and prevent time and radial
coordinate interchange. The associated hypersurface is not contractible and corresponds to
a space bridge linking two Minkowski spacetimes though a throat sphere. As the
determinant of the metric vanishes on that sphere one gets an orbifold structure. When
crossing that sphere the particles experience a PT, mass and energy inversions.

In 1916 Karl Schwarzschild publishes [1] a solution of the vacuum Einstein equations
(without second term) correspond to time translation invariance and spherical symmetry. It
is only in 1999 that an English translation of this article will be available [2] thanks to
S.Antoci et A.Loinger. Schwarzschild decides to express this  solution by using a first set of
real variables  
(a)
                                                           
The solution is then given in the form : 
(b)                            
He then introduces an intermediary variable : 
(c)                                                                                     
Which,  given (a) is essentially positive. 
He performs a new coordinates change that allows him to simply express the spherical
symmetry hypothesis : 
(d)

He then obains the form : 
(e)                                 
In order for the metric to be lorentzian at infinity it is necessary that : 
 
    implies    
(f)                                           
He introduces next a new change of coordinates : 
(g)                                           
Note that (a) + (c) imply that 
In those new coordinates the metric becomes :

This perimeter has a minimal value 
The r variable cannot be considered as a « radial distance ». This hypersurface does not have
a « centre », the object corresponding to r = 0 hence to a> x = y = z = 0 is not a dot but a sphere
of radius 
. 
We will now replicate Scharzschild's calculations by replacing  the x, y, z and t variables by 
Greek characters (

to assimilate them to distances (x, y and z) or time (t) and lose sight of what they
really are: real numbers. 
Let us consider the zero second member Einstein equation 
 in time independent and
spherically symmetrical conditions. Let

The other ones are zero. Due to rotational symmetry it is sufficient to write the field
equations only for the equator 
, therefore, since they will be differentiated only
once, in the previous expressions it is possible to set everywhere since the begining

that we found for f1 and f2 
Therefore all the conditions are satisfied except the condition of continuity. 
f1 will be discontinuous when      
In order this disconinuity coincides with the origin, it must be :

It vanishes on the throat sphere. As a consequence, on this last we cannot define gaussian
coordinates, so that the object is no longer a manifold but an orbifold. On the throat sphere
the arrow of time and the space orientation cannot ne defined. This can be interpreted as a
geometric structure where space and time are reversed through the throat sphere : when a
particle crosses the throat sphere it experiences a PT-symmetry. According to Souriau’s
theorem [4]  this T-inversion goes with a mass inversion. 
In a future paper the physical interpretation of such solution will be investigated.
