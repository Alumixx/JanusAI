Abstract After a review citing the results obtained in pre-
vious articles introducing the Janus Cosmological Model,
consisting of a set of two coupled ﬁeld equations, where
one metrics refers to the positive masses and the other to
the negative masses, which explains the observed cosmic
acceleration and the nature of dark energy, we present the
Lagrangian derivation of the model.

1 Introduction

After F. Zwicky in 1931 and V. Rubin in 1979 pointing out
the missing mass problem, the cosmological model was en-
riched with a new unidentiﬁed ingredient, the so called dark
matter. Then a new problem appeared (Riess et al. 1998;
Perlmutter et al. 1999; Riess 2000, 2004; Filippenko and
Riess 2001; Leibundgut 2001; Knop et al. 2003; Tonry et al.
2003): instead of slowing down the universe was accelerat-
ing. Another distinct ingredient was added: dark energy. In
Faraoni (2009), Faraoni et al. (2014) we quote:

–Dark energy and dark matter are the basic con-
stituents of the universe.

In this paper the authors, thinking about the interaction be-
tween those two, try to build a Lagrangian whose varia-

tion would give rise to the interacting equations. Follow-
ing a completely different idea, Milgrom (1983, 1998), Mil-
grom and Sanders (2007) suggests an ad-hoc modiﬁcation
of Newton’s law. But this last does not ﬁt galactic clusters
data. Nevertheless Combes (2015a, 2015b) following Mil-
grom extends the idea to a set of four successive ad-hoc laws
depending on distance (Combes 2015a, 2015b). We quote:

–Gravity must be modiﬁed, adding a term, ﬁrst at
galactic scale, then another one to clusters of galaxies
scale, and ﬁnally a third to very large scale—the one
of dark energy.

Negative mass related to negative pressure could explain the
observed acceleration. Alas, in 1957 Bondi (1957) showed
that the introduction of such ingredient in the Einstein’s
model produced unmanageable interaction laws. Einstein’s
equation, without cosmological constant, is:
Rμν − 1

Rgμν = χ Tμν

(1)

When we apply Newtonian approximation (Adler et al.
1967, 10.5), expanding the metric into a series, from a
Lorentz metric gμν = ημν + εγμν we get Newton’s law.
Bondi writes:

d2(cid:2)r1
dt 2

= G((cid:2)r2 − (cid:2)r1)m(1)
|(cid:2)r2 − (cid:2)r1|3

p m(2)

a

(2)

where m(i) is inertial mass, m(p) passive gravitational mass,
and m(a) active gravitational mass. From equivalence prin-
ciple m(i) = m(p), so that:
= G((cid:2)r2 − (cid:2)r1)m(1)
d2(cid:2)r1
p m(2)
|(cid:2)r2 − (cid:2)r1|3
dt 2

A consequence of (3) is that positive masses (m(a) > O)
attract everything, while negative masses repel everything,

 67

– Negative masses mutually attract through Newton’s law.
– Masses with opposite signs mutually repel through “anti-

Newton’s law”.

The present system was introduced in 1994 (Petit 1994).
In 1995 (Petit 1995), 2D numerical simulations were per-
formed. Assuming, after discoupling from radiation, that
negative matter is denser, this last ﬁrstly forms clusters by
gravitational instability, repelling positive matter in the rem-
nant space, which forms a lacunar pattern, see Fig. 2. The
whole is found very stable, the net of positive matter pre-
venting negative clusters merging, while these last play the
role of anchors, stabilizing the lacunar positive pattern.

This theory has to be compared with recent results (Pi-
ran 1997; El-Ad et al. 1996, 1997; El-Ad and Piran 1997).
Recently a new 2D simulation (Petit et al. 2015), performed
on recent computers (5,000 positive mass points; 5,000 neg-
ative) introduced a compact 2D workspace, replacing eu-
clidean distance, by distance measured along geodesics, see
Fig. 3.

In Petit (1995) negative gravitational lensing effect was
presented, which explained available data. The positive lens-
ing is reinforced by the focusing action of negative mat-
ter environment, while this last explained galaxies’ conﬁne-
ment. In 2000 another 2D simulation (Petit et al. (2001))
produced barred spirals, stable over 30 turns, the structure
being due to dynamical friction with negative matter envi-
ronment.

On the right of Fig. 4 we see a strong reduction of
galaxy’s momentum, due to dynamical friction, during ﬁve
turns, which becomes almost negligible after that. Negative
matter produces a potential barrier, which prevents spiral
arms dissipation. Modifying the ratio negative mass/positive
mass, different patterns are obtained, as shown in Fig. 5,
which suggests a possible galaxies’ evolution schema.

All these results were obtained on a personal computer.
Collaboration with a group owing a fast computer could ex-
tend that work to 3D simulations, with compact workspace
(S3 sphere). Anyway, it is important to keep in mind that
RG does not produce particles, only geodesics. The model
is indeed a “pure geometrical description”. As the model ﬁts
observation, we deduce that photons follow null-geodesics
and matter follows non-null geodesics. In the Janus model,
the second metric g(−)
μν produces a second, distinct, geodesic
system. Similarly, we can assume that negative energy
photons follow corresponding null-geodesics and negative
masses follow corresponding non-null geodesics. Double
Newtonian approximation (6) (around Lorentz Metrics) pro-
vides interaction schema. In (Petit and D’Agostini 2014a,
2014b) an exact solution of system (4a)+(4b) for matter
dominated era is built. Positive matter is found to accelerate,
it obeys Bonnor’s equation (Bonnor 1989). In the literature,
dark matter and dark energy are considered as distinct (un-
known) ingredients. In contrast, our new Janus Model takes

Fig. 1 The preposterous runaway phenomenon

which produces the preposterous runaway phenomenon:
when a mass +m encounters a mass −m, the ﬁrst runs away,
chased by the second. Both experience a uniform accelera-
tion, while kinetic energy is saved, because one mass is neg-
ative, see Fig. 1. This analysis banned negative masses from
cosmology during 57 years.

2 Back to “full geometry”

In a former paper (Petit and D’Agostini 2014a, 2014b) we
suggested to replace Einstein’s equation by a set of two cou-
pled ﬁeld equations, which is a change of paradigm, which
ﬁts local veriﬁcations of RG, as shown in the following:

the two variations is required. Let’s write:
δg(+)μν = −δg(−)μν

A question arises immediately: what could be the physi-
cal signiﬁcance of such a link? The two metrics belong
to a functional space. First, have a look on the external
Schwarzschild metric (Schwarzschild 1916):

Such metric belongs to a metrics’ subspace whose elements
depend on a single parameter M. As described ﬁrst in Pe-
tit (1994, 1995), Petit et al. (2001) the metric solutions
(g(+)
μν , g(−)
μν ) of coupled ﬁeld equations are joint solutions.
For example, if an external Schwarzschild solution refers to
a portion of empty space surrounding a positive mass M (+)

Similar calculation shows that δg(+)μν = ϕ(r)δM (+),
δg(−)μν = −ϕ(r)δM (+). Then the coupled metrics obey
(14).

An external Schwarzschild’s metric element is “orga-
nized” around some mass concentration M. For example,
if we neglect the planetary system, the geometry of the solar
system depends on a single parameter, the mass M of the
Sun.

During the matter-dominated era, the distribution of mat-
ter is not described by a continuous distribution of mass.
Matter is located in relatively small and ﬁnite portions of
space, surrounded by void, which is consistent with relation-
ship (14).

Anyway we will consider Eq. (14) as the mathematical

deﬁnition of Janus geometry.

If one assumes that the two speeds of light c(+) and c(−) are
equal, we can set c(+) = c(1) = 1 and ﬁnd again the system
(1a)+(1b) which has been introduced and studied in Petit
and D’Agostini (2014a, 2014b).
For c(+) (cid:6)= c(−) conditions, the paper (Petit and D’Agos-

tini 2014a, 2014b) gives more details.

4 Physical features from Janus geometry

In reference Petit and D’Agostini (2014a, 2014b), we have
built the Newtonian approximation. Then interaction laws
and behavior arise, different from Bondi (1957) and Bonnor
(1989).

– Masses with same signs mutually attract along Newton’s

– Masses with opposite signs mutually repel along “Anti-

law

Newton’s” law

Simulations have shown that the two populations separate
by Petit (1995). This phenomenon agrees with Piran (1997),
El-Ad et al. (1996, 1997), El-Ad and Piran (1997).

Time-dependent exact solution (Petit and D’Agostini
2014a, 2014b) agrees with Riess et al. (1998), Perlmutter
et al. (1999), Riess (2000); Filippenko and Riess (2001),
Leibundgut (2001), Knop et al. (2003), Tonry et al. (2003),
Riess (2004).

The link between mass inversion and time inversion

(Souriau 1970) was presented in Petit et al. (2001).

The model ﬁts local observational data. Indeed, negative
matter is negligible around the Sun so that the system re-
duces to:

This corresponds to an “induced geometry”, due to the ac-
tion of negative mass on positive mass and positive energy
photons paths (negative gravitational lensing, ﬁrstly pre-
sented by Petit 1995).

5 Conclusion

Based on Janus condition, deﬁning Janus geometry (14), La-
grangian derivation of the set of two ﬁeld equations corre-
sponding to our Janus Cosmological Model (JCM) is pre-
sented. Observational agreement is detailed. Slightly sim-
ilar works from other authors correspond to Hossenfelder
(2008) and Henry-Couannier (2005). In the paper (Petit and
D’Agostini 2014a, 2014b) the model explains the acceler-
ation of the Universe and suggests the nature of so-called
dark energy. The paper (Petit and D’Agostini 2014a, 2014b)
deals with different speeds of light, for positive and negative
particles. A future paper to be published is devoted to radia-
tion dominated era and to variable constants regime that will
explain c(−) > c(+).
