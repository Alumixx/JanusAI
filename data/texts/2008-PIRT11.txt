Abstract 
The  universe,  far  from  being  homogenous,  expands  in  large  empty  bubbles  of  large-scale 
structure,  but  not  in  mass  concentrations  like  galaxies,  so  that  the  Robertson-Walker  solution 
does not fit. We suggest that a symmetry breaking occurred in a distant past, during the radiation-
dominated era. Before, the three-dimensional hypersurface was invariant under the action of O(3) 
and  the  Robertson-Walker  solution  could  be  used.  But  this  obliges  the  so  called  constants  of 
physics, length and time scale factors, to be involved through a generalized gauge process, which 
is thus built. The subsequent variation of the speed of light solves the horizon problem, while the 
Planck barrier disappears.  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
The  present  work  is  fairly  different  from  other  attempts  published  on  the  now  so-called  VSL, 
variable speed of light. The reader will find these other papers mentioned in the references at the 
end of  this paper.  
 
1) Introduction 
 
Let's present the general idea. The classical cosmological model was built from the Robertson-
Walker  solution  of  the  Einstein  field  equations.  This  solution  is  based  on  the  cosmological 
principle  assuming  the  Universe  is  homogeneous  and  isotropic.  Initially  the  model-makers 
believed that they could consider the Universe as a gas whose molecules would be the galaxies. 
In clusters these galaxies have a random velocity which may be compared to the thermal velocity 
of  the  kinetic  theory  of  gases.  The  order  of  magnitude  of  the  random  galaxy  velocities,  with 
respect to the galaxy clusters, is around 1000 km/s, which is small if compared to the speed of 
light. So that theoreticians thought that this velocity could be neglected, this cosmic fluid being 
compared to dust ("dust Universe"). This was widely confirmed by observations. 
Oppositely the observation of the large-scale structure gave evidence that matter was arranged 
around big voids, 100 light-years across in the mean, to be compared to joined soap bubbles". 
That was frankly non-homogeneous. As a consequence the curvature field is non-uniform. 
A  puzzling  problem  arises.  Astronomers  measure  redshifts  and  conclude  that  the  Universe  is 
expanding,  according  to  Hubble's  law.  But  where  does  this  expansion  occur?  Does  the  solar 
system expand? No. If it were expanding, it would be unstable. Do the galaxies expand? No, for 
the same reason.  
To explain the measured redshifts we must admit some regions expand in the Universe and some 
others  do  not.  Basically,  the  Robertson-Walker  metric  cannot  take  into  account  this  non-
homogeneity. In the Robertson-Walker metric we find a length scale factor R which depends only 
on the time-marker x°. It does not depend on space coordinates. It is supposed to be constant over 
the  whole  three-dimensional  hypersurface  S(x°)  at  a  given  instant  x°.  It  does  not  fit  the 
observations so that we should think about a length scale factor which would depend on time and

space.  At  microscopic  scale  we  find  cosmological,  primeval  photons  forming  the  CMB,  the 
cosmic microwave background radiation. Let us write their average wavelength as λ. It expands 
like the length scale factor R. The great voids are filled by such photons. Here is the expansion of 
the Universe. Photons behave like oscillations moving on an expanding cloth. 
 
A material particle, whose mass is m, is associated to with a characteristic Compton's length: 
(1) 

c =λ

 

h
cm

 

If  we  consider  the  Planck  constant  h,  the  speed  of  light  c  and  the  mass  m  are  invariant,  this 
Compton's  length  does  not  vary  in  time.  From  this  point  of  view,  photons  expand  but  matter 
doesn't. This corresponds to an idea introduced by Mach in 1883. In 1990, I illustrated this idea 
using  a  didactic  image,  in  my  book  "The  Chronologicon"  from  the  series  "The  Adventures  of 
Archibald Higgins". This is the corresponding part, page 61:

When we travel backwards in time, the Universe becomes hotter and hotter and, quoting Steven 
Weinberg in his famous book "The first three minutes", it is "a mixture of all kinds of radiations". 
At this time, based on the CMB observation, the Universe looks very homogeneous. If we keep in 
mind the image of ice cubes immersed in water, they would melt and produce an homogeneous 
mixture.  
 
This suggests a symmetry breaking, occurring in distant time during the radiation-dominated era.  
Have a look at the Robertson-Walker metric. First we define Gaussian coordinates, which implies 
that the three-dimensional surface is "oriented in space" and "oriented in time".  
 

-  One assumes that there exists a global time-coordinate, a global time-marker x° 

 

 

-  Space is assumed to be locally isotropic. 

-  Any  two  points  in  a  three-dimensional  space  belonging  to  a  fixed  value  of  the  time-

coordinate are equivalent.  

 
We  choose  an  arbitrary  point  of  the  three-dimensional  space  to  be  the  origin  of  spherical 
coordinates (r ,θ , ϕ).  
Introducing a length scale factor R(x°) we can write: 
(2) 

r = R(x°) u         

 

where  u is an adimensional variable. 
 
Then the  Robertson-Walker line element becomes:

k = { -1 , 0 , +1 } is the curvature index. The coordinates  (u , θ , ϕ) are pure numbers or angles. 
The hypothesis of isotropy and homogeneity gives a R-field which only depends on time. A point 
whose  coordinates  (u  , θ  , ϕ)  are  invariant  is  called  co-moving  (with  space).  As  pointed  out 
earlier this description does not fit the observational data.  
 
We can offer a 2d didactic image of such geometry. See figure 2. On the right we have drawn a 
cube  with  blunt  vertices.  Each  vertex  is  one  eighth  of  a  sphere.  The  eight  blunt  corners  are 
connected  through  portions  (quarters)  of  cylinders  and  square  flat  surfaces,  i.e.  Euclidean 
elements.  The  two  images  3  and  4  in  figure  2  suggest  the  expansion  of  a  closed  Universe 
containing eight "mass concentrations" (the eight blunt vertices). The flat surfaces expand, not 
the curved corners. These keep a constant area. This is a didactic image of a closed Universe with 
mass  concentration  areas  (that  do  not  expand)  separated  by  voids  (the  Euclidean  portion  of 
cylinders and flat squares).  
 
The time-sequence is supposed to go from image 1 to image 4. In image 2 the eight portions of 
the sphere join together. Then this closed universe becomes a sphere, that has O(2) symmetry. 
We find a symmetry breaking from step 2 to step 3. Before, the O(2) symmetry holds. After, it 
doesn't.

closed Universe experiencing a symmetry breaking in step 2.  

 

 
Geometers can immediately extend this for a three-dimensional closed surface, illustrated as a set 
of flat volumes joined to constant curvature portions of space. In the two-dimensional model we 
have shown eight "mass concentrations", but we could put as many as we want, thus forming a 
diamond-like  object,  with  blunt  vertices  (rounded  summits).  Similarly,  a  3-sphere  could  be 
transformed  into  a  many-3d-faces  3d-diamond  whose  curved  volumes  would  be  smoothed 
(constant curvature and constant volume object) linked by Euclidean elements.  
 
Similarly  we  could  imagine  a  symmetry  breaking.  Before  the  objects  is  a  3-sphere,  having  an 
O(3) symmetry. After, this symmetry is broken or lost. The object becomes a three-dimensional 
polyhedron  where  each  constant  curvature  (and  volume)  portion  represents  a  galaxy  or  some 
mass concentration that does not expand. .  
 
This  is  the  general  idea.  We  suppose  the  Robertson-Walker  metric  is  suitable  to  describe  the 
(homogeneous) early Universe. Then a symmetry breaking occurs, very early in the radiation-
dominated  era.  Matter  concentrations  begin  to  form.  We  suggest  that  this  corresponds  to  two 
different evolution processes. 
 
When we want to build a model of cosmic evolution we have to deal with: 
 

-  Pure geometric features, governed by Einstein's field equations 

-  Features linked to special relativity (invariance through Lorentz rotations) 

-  Electromagnetic  features  (the  particles  are  linked  by  electromagnetic  forces,  ruled  by 

-  Quantification  is  present,  which  is  governed  by,  for  example,  the  (non  relativistic) 

Maxwell's equations) 

Schrödinger equation.

All these features come from local observations and experiments, which satisfy a certain set of 
physical equations, containing  the following quantities:  
 
 

G: gravitational constant 
c: speed of light 
m: masses 
h: Planck constant 
e: elementary charge 
µ : magnetic constant (vacuum permeability) 
o

 
 
From  this  set  of  equations  we  can  build  measuring  instruments.  They  extend  our  senses.  But 
finally the last measuring instrument is ourselves, with our body as a length scale and our average 
life, a "shelf time", as a time scale. We may compare this duration to astronomical phenomena, 
like the year, the day (a complete rotation of the Earth). We can build mechanical systems, like a 
torsion  pendulum,  and  discover  that  they  can  be  used  as  clocks.  Comparing  this  object  to  our 
body, our hand, we can build rules. We can divide it, and so on.  
 
We replace the fully human measurement by mechanical measurements, based on the equations 
of physics. It works. We can perform measurements of constants and we don't find any change, 
so we think they should be absolute constants. Quantum mechanics works too and brings a new 
insight  into  the  nature  of  matter.  From  the  constant  of  today's  physics  we  can  build  two 
characteristic quantities  
 
The Planck length:

Quantum mechanics generates its own limits in space and time. It becomes impossible, through 
QM  formalism,  to  analyze  or  even  to  conceive  processes  occurring  on  lengths  and  durations 
shorter than these characteristic values. 
 
As  the  scientist  believes  the  constants  found  are  absolute  constants  that  do  not  vary  alongside 
cosmic evolution, he thinks of some hypothetical "quantum era" and asks how things could have 
been in the extremely early conditions.

2) Existence of a fundamental gauge relation 
 
All  physicists  know  the  power  of  dimensional  analysis.  Considering  a  given  set  of  physical 
equations they can introduce characteristic length and time and introduce adimensional space and 
time variables. Then they can weight, measure the relative importance of different terms in an 
equation in which the constants of physics appear.  
 
This could be extended, considering that we can use today's values of the constants, considering 
they  may  vary,  and  introduce  their  adimensional  form.  As  an  example,  let  us  consider  the 
constant of gravitation. Call Go today's measured value. If we admit that G may vary, we can 
write: 
(6) 

G = Γ  Go 

 
Γ  being an adimensional quantity. We can do similar operations for all constants, as we do for 
length and time. Now, ask the question:  
 

-  Can we find what we will call a generalized gauge transform, linking the length and time 
scale factors, and the adimensional variables, which takes into account the variation of the 
physical constants, and which would keep all the equations invariant? 

 
The answer is yes. There is a single one, see reference [4]. Note that we cannot obtain evidence 
of such variations using our measuring instruments. The reason is very simple: these systems are 
precisely built from these quantities, so it becomes impossible to find evidence for any constant 
variation among all these constants of physics.  
 
Similarly, if you wish to measure the dilatation of a table made of iron, using a ruler made of the 
same  metal,  due  to  ambient  thermal  variation  you  could  not  as  the  table  and  the  scale  would 
experience the same parallel variations. 
 
We will present further this generalized gauge transform. If R and T are respectively the length 
and time scale factors, all the characteristic lengths of physics, including the Planck length, are 
found to vary like R. All the characteristic times of physics are found to vary like T. In addition, 
all  the  energies  are  conserved.  This  remarkable  gauge  property  is  based  on  a  group,  to  be 
discovered.  
 
 
 
3) Today's physics 
 
No  astronomer  would  pretend  that  the  solar  system  or  the  galaxies  expand  with  the  Universe. 
Consider  some  sort  of  reference  system  composed  by  two  masses  m  circling  around  their 
common center of gravity:

If  the  radius  of  this  circular  orbit  was  extended,  the  system  would  become  unstable.  In  the 
classical  vision  of  celestial  mechanics, G  and  m    are  considered  to  be  absolute  constants.  The 
kinetic  energy  and  angular  momentum  are  conserved,  so  that  V  does  not  change  neither.  This 
circular  orbit  could  not  be  co-moving  in  a  Robertson-Walker  geometry,  where  the  expansion 
occurs everywhere.  
the  geodesics  of  a  four-dimensional  space-time 
In  general  relativity,  masses  follows 
hypersurface.  These  masses  cannot  follow  geodesics  associated  with  the  Robertson-Walker 
metric. We do not know, presently, how to build a solution of to the field equations which takes 
into  account  these  features.  When  we  make  local  calculations,  for  example  for  perihelion 
precession of Mercury or gravitational lensing, we use time-independent Schwarzschild solutions 
to the field equations.  
 
Let us return to our didactic image: the cube with blunt vertices and smooth edges. Our circular 
orbit takes place in the non-expanding zone, in a corner which does not expand.  
 
 

 

Figure 4: Reference circular orbit location 

 
 
This  is  a  composite  geometry  since  curved  and  flat  elements  form  the  object.  To  be  closer  to 
reality,  this  circular  orbit  should  be  inscribed  in  a  non-expanding  volume,  part  of  a  three-
dimensional hypersurface. There, it would be part of a region of space-time that would behave 
like  a  quasi  steady-state  element  of  the  geometric  solution,  while  the  area  between  the  mass 
concentrations space-time would be close to a Friedman non-steady solution. Currently we do not 
know how to manage that.

4) The early evolution as a generalized gauge process 
 
If  we  go  further  backwards  into  the  past,  we  meet  the  symmetry  breaking  event.  Then  the 
Robertson-Walker  solution  holds  and  the  Universe  obeys  an  O(3)  symmetry.  If  we  want  to 
inscribe the circular orbit corresponding to our two masses linked by gravitational force, the span 
of this co-moving orbit must vary like R(x°). See the small circle: 
 

 

Figure 5: 2d didactic image of the symmetry breaking 

 
We  will  assume  the  Universe  undergoes  a  generalized  gauge  process,  keeping  the  equations 
invariant. At the end of this study the benefit will be the justification of the homogeneity of the 
early  Universe  with  no  need  to  call  for  the  inflation  theory.  Let  us  build  the  gauge  laws.  As 
shown  in  [1]  this  gauge  process  make  all  the  characteristic  lengths  of  physics  to  follow  the 
variation of the length scale factor R. The energies are conserved. Look at the invariance of the 
field equation, in which we take a cosmological constant equal to zero, while it does not refer to 
early Universe and short range gravitational interaction. 
 (8) 

S = χ T 

 
It is divergenceless, which implies that the constant χ must be an absolute constant. This last is 
classically determined through an expansion into a series of the metric,  the zero-order term being 
the time-independent Lorentz metric. We add a perturbation term which is also time-independent: 
(9)                                                                 g = η + ε γ 
 
We perform a Newtonian approximation (weak field, low velocities with respect to the speed of 
light). The constant is determined, identifying the linearized field equation to Poisson's equation. 
The expression depends on how we decide to write the tensor T. Let us follow [20], section 10.5: 
(10) 

 
Then the identification gives: 
(11)

The Einstein equation is invariant if  
(12)                                                                
 
Notice that, when we determine the expression of Einstein's constant combining G an c in (11), 
this does not imply that these two should be absolute constants, for the perturbation method is 
based on time-independent terms in the expansion into a series of the metric.  
Writing that the Schwarzschild length varies like R, we get:

Remark that:

Writing that the energy  h ν = h / τ  is conserved we obtain: 
(19)                                                        
 
Notice this looks like a first link between quantum and gravitational worlds. Let us look now to 
electromagnetism. Write the Bohr radius varying like R:

We  can  complete  that,  assuming  that  the  fine-structure  constant α  does  not  vary  in  this  gauge 
evolution process:

This would be a consequence of the invariance of Maxwell's equations, coupled to the hypothesis 
of electromagnetic energy conservation [26]. Of course we would find that all the characteristic 
lengths of electromagnetism (like the Debye length) vary like R, while the coulomb cross section 
varies like R2. Similarly all the characteristic times of physics are found to vary like the time scale 
factor T. This gives one gauge variation law keeping all equations invariant. 
As we said, our goal is to justify the observed homogeneity of the early Universe without calling 
on  inflation  theory  to  rescue  the  model.  At  this  level  we  must  start  from  the  results  of  our 
bimetric  model,  presented  in  an  earlier  paper  [18].  We  recall  that  the  motivation  then  was  to 
clarify  the  nature  of  so-called  "dark  energy",  producing  the  late  acceleration  of  the  expansion 
process.  This  "component"  of  the  Universe  was  identified  with  a  second  kind  of  mass  and 
photons, possessing negative energy (notice that this bimetric model has nothing to do with other 
authors' works using this technique).  
 
5) Link with our bimetric model 
 
Let us give the basis of this bimetric model. We assume that the Universe contains two kinds of 
particles.  The  first,  with  positive  or  zero  mass  and  positive  energy,  follow  the  geodesics 
corresponding to a first metric g  +. The second ones, with negative or zero mass and negative 
energy,  follow  the  geodesics  built  from  a  second  metric  g  -.  As  explained  in  the  reference 
mentioned, the two metrics are coupled through the following field equations:  
(22)                                                     S + (g +)  =  χ (  T + - T  –)  
(23)                                                     S –  (g –)  =  χ (  T  – - T +)  
 
Assuming  the  Universe  to  be  isotropic  and  homogeneous,  at  very  large  scale  we  introduce 
Robertson-Walker metrics, with their own length and time scale factors R + and  R –, which gives 
the two coupled differential equations:

The obvious divergence of the solution has been evoked to construe the observed acceleration. As 
the time-marker x° grows, the solutions become more and more divergent. The negative energy 
component behaves like repellent "dark energy" and accelerates our positive energy matter. But 
when  going  backwards  in  time,  the  two  scale  factors  get  the  same  value  and  follow  a  linear 
evolution in x°. If it is identified with a cosmic time t, through x° = ct, c being considered as an 
absolute constant, this evolution becomes so slow that all the hydrogen of the Universe would be 
converted into helium.

Figure 6: The bimetric cosmological model ( R + , R – ) as functions of the time-marker x° 

In figure 7 we have represented the evolution of our reference system, of two masses coupled by 
gravitation,  with  the  time-marker  x°.  At  the  very  beginning  the  radius  of  the  orbit  follows  the 
growth of the length scale factor R. The two geodesics spiral along and around a cone. Then the 
symmetry breaking occurs. The portion of space where the circular orbit is located is in a non-
expanding region: the geodesics spiral along the length of a cylinder. Shown : the world-lines of 
co-moving particles.

is homogeneous and the orbit grows like R. Then its radius becomes constant.

6) Link with physics and observation 
 
To  build  a  cosmological  model  we  need  to  make  a  certain  choice  of    coordinates,  which  are 
supposed  to  represent  physical  quantities,  in  order  to  map  our  geometrical  solution  (3).  We 
choose those that keep the equations of physics invariant, so that, in this early Universe, ruled by 
a generalized gauge, process the physical time becomes :

This model goes with a Planck length varying like R (while the Planck time varies like T) we see 
that the Planck barrier disappears. The creation of this Planck barrier is due to the hypothesis that 
the  constants  of  physics  do  not  vary.  Doint  that,  we  project  the  local  and  present  aspects  of 
microphysics towards the most distant past.  
 
 
7) The Zeno’s paradox 
 
How can we build a clock? Let us go back to our system composed of two masses circling around 
their  common  center  of  gravity,  now  considered  as  an  elementary  clock.  There  is  no  absolute 
measurement  of  time,  only  a  relative  measure,  a  comparison  of  a  duration  with  respect  to  a 
reference  one.  In  any  case  a  turn  represents  some  sort  of  time  measurement.  Following  the 
breadcrumbs trail that is the chronological time-marker x° we can count how many turns occur 
from a given instant  X° to the value zero of x°.   
The period is t:

We  may  consider  a  turn  of  this  "elementary  clock"  as  an  "elementary  event".  From  a 
mathematical point of view, the Robertson-Walker solution starts from a zero value of the length 
scale factor R. The count of the number of turns of our "elementary clock" evokes well known  
Zeno's paradox.  
 
What could be the meaning of such a result? It seems to mean that when we go backwards in 
time,  towards  what  we  consider  as  an  origin  or  singularity,  an  infinite  number  or  "elementary 
events" occurs. Then the universe looks like a very peculiar book. The chronological time-marker 
x° is the width of the book. As we flick through it to get back to the beginning, its pages get

thinner  and  thinner.  Infinity  of  pages  needs  to  be  flicked  through  to  get  to  the  start  of  the 
beginning, and we can never read the author's preface. 
 
 
8) The evolution of the constants of physics 
 
For the early Universe we have assumed that a symmetry breaking occurred during the radiation-
dominated era. Then the evolution was phrased through equations (12) to (21). A question arises. 
If there is a phase transition, when does it occur and why? We cannot answer the question at the 
present  time.  If  we  express  the  generalized  gauge  process,  choosing  the  density    of 
electromagnetic energy (which is dominant) as the "leading parameter", we obtain:

There are regions in the Universe where density can reach extremely high values: in the cores of 
neutron stars (in such a place it is as if the universe's evolution was going backward in time). The 
state of the matter in the core of the star is similar to that of the very early Universe). It could be 
interesting  to  consider  the  evolution  of  this  star  core  beyond  a  certain  density  value,  as 
accompanying an alteration of local physical constants, as local length and time scale factors. We 
speculate that this could modify the topology inside the core, bearing a hypertoric space bridge 
suitable  for  transferring  excess  matter  to  another  Universe.  Another  paper  will  discuss  this 
possibility, giving insights into the first work undertaken on this idea. 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
We started from the remark that the Robertson-Walker solution, assuming the cosmos is isotropic 
and homogeneous, does not describe the observed universe since it is clearly non-homogeneous, 
and that expansion is supposed not to occur within the vast regions occupied by galaxies. We 
suggested this non-homogeneity was born from a symmetry breaking that happened in a distant 
past, where the three dimensional hypersurface lost its symmetry O(3).  
 
We  proposed  the  hypothesis  that  masses,  and  in  particular  a  couple  of  masses  m  linked  by 
gravitational force and orbiting around their common center of gravity, follow the geodesics of 
the  four-dimensional  space-time  hypersurface.  We  have  shown  that  this  is  possible,  if  the 
equations  of  physics  are  to  keep  their  validity,  only  if  the  physical  constants  undergo  joint 
variations. 
  
We established the gauge variation laws linking them, as well as the length and time scale factors. 
We obtained a description of cosmic evolution where the cosmological horizon varies like the 
length scale factor, which guarantees the homogeneity of the early Universe without calling on 
the inflation theory.  
 
In this generalized gauge process, before the symmetry breaking occurs, all characteristic lengths 
of  physics  vary  like  the  length  scale  factor  R,  while  all  characteristic  times  vary  like  the  time 
scale factor T.  In this way the Plank barrier disappears.  
 
Focusing  on  our  two  mass  system  linked  by  gravitational  force,  we  assimilated  it  to  an 
elementary  clock  where  time  would  be  measured  by  each  turn  count.  After  the  symmetry 
breaking,  the number of turns evolves like classical cosmic time, following from x° = ct  with c 
being  an  absolute  constant.  We  have  shown  that  in  the  previous  era,  before  this  symmetry 
breaking, the elementary clock makes an infinite number of turns which brings up the problem of 
the definitions of "time" and of the "origin".
