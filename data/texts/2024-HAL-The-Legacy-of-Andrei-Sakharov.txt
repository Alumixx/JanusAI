Abstract :  The  fact  that  the  standard  model  of  cosmology  LCDM  cannot  account  for  the 
presence of immense voids in the very large-scale structure, as well as the early birth of first-
generation stars and galaxies, combined with the impossibility of explaining the absence of 
observations of primordial antimatter, means that we are forced to consider a paradigm shift, 
which is what the Janus model represents. This model has its origins in the one proposed by 
Andrei  Sakharov  in  1967.  We  retrace  this  genesis,  focusing  on  the  model's  physical  and 
mathematical coherence.  
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
1 - Introduction. 
 
Between 1967 and 1980, A.Sakharov published articles ([1], [2], [3]) presenting a cosmological 
model with two universes, linked by an initial singularity, the Big Bang. The first is our own 
universe. The second is described by him as a twin universe. The time arrows of these two 
universes are antiparallel, and they are enantiomorphic, or mirrored. Through such a model, 
he proposed a possible answer to the lack of observation of primordial antimatter. For over 
half a century now, cosmology has been unable to conceal one of its greatest weaknesses. Not 
only has no answer been found to the fact that one particle of matter in a million escaped 
complete  annihilation,  but  no  explanation  has  yet  been  proposed  for  the  absence  of 
observation of the corresponding quantity of primordial antimatter. Sakharov's attention was 
focused  on  the  violation  of  CP  symmetry.  To  re-establish  a  generalized  symmetry,  he 
hypothesized that our universe would be endowed with a twin in which these violations would 
be reversed. Based on the fact that matter arises from the assembly of quarks and antimatter 
from the assembly of antiquarks, he hypothesized that the former reaction would have been 
faster than the latter in our sheet of universe, with the opposite situation in its twin. Thus, in 
our matter universe we would find a small remnant of matter, associated with an equivalent 
remnant  of  free-state  antiquarks,  with  the  opposite  situation  in  this  twin  universe,  which 
would  therefore  contain  antimatter  with  a  corresponding  remnant  of  free-state  quarks. 
However exotic this model may seem, we have to agree that it's the only answer we've been

given to this loss of half the cosmic content. Thus it's only logical that we should try to examine 
the aspects of such a model. 
 
2 – The significance of this inversion of time. 
 
This T-symmetry refers to the inversion of the time coordinate. In 1970 [4], contributing to the 
development  of  symplectic  geometry  and  its  application  to  physics,  mathematician 
J.M.Souriau provided the physical interpretation of this inversion of the time coordinate. The 
Gramm matrix defining the Minkowski space is :

Its isometry group is the Poincaré group:

A very detailed commentary on the work can be found in reference [5]. The approach is based 
on the introduction of the space of motions as a dual of the Lie algebra of the group. This 
space of motions is thus a vector space of dimension 10, that of the group. Within these 
dimensions, one is identified with the energy E, of the motion, three others with its impulse, 
three with the spin (not quantized) and three others with a 3-vector qualified by Souriau as 
“passage f”. Together, they form a torsor :

If we opt for a coordinate system accompanying motion, then the 3-vector f is zero. Seven 
parameters thus define a motion, defining a geodesic trajectory of Minkowski space.  The 
action of the group on its motion space allows us to define all possible motions. This is written 
( equations (13.107) in chapter 13 of reference [4] ).

  is  the  neutral  component,  which  contains  the  neutral  element  of  the  group  and 

It's the second equation that sheds light on the physical significance of this inversion of the 
time coordinate.  The Lorentz group has four related components:  
 
  Ln{

reverses neither space nor time.

Finally, 
 
The Poincaré group inherits this property. Classically, physics limits its use to its orthochronous 
components. Note that :

This gives the result of reference [4]: time inversion is synonymous with energy inversion. This 
also leads to mass inversion [4].  
 
(14)                                                                  
 
Here we discover the physical interpretation of the model proposed by A. Sakharov: his second 
universe contains particles with negative energy and negative mass, when they have them. 
 
 
3 – Introduction of electric charge.  
 
This is synonymous with charge conjugation and matter-antimatter duality. The geometrical 
interpretation of this C-symmetry was given in 1964 by J.M.Souriau in chapter V of reference 

 m = Pt.P sgn(E)

space, whose Gramm matrix is :

 Whereas the Lorentz group is of dimension 6, this group is of dimension 10, bringing the 
number of dimensions of the isometry group of Kaluza space to 15. Adding a fifth dimension 
has the effect of endowing the moment space with additional dimensions, five in this case. In 
2014 [7] the author restricted the extension of the group L under bounded space to : 
 

⎛

This  limits  us  to  the  subgroup  of  translations  in  this  fifth  dimension.  The  treatment  by 
constructing the action of this new group on the dual of its Lie algebra endows the moment 
with an additional scalar, which can be identified with the electric charge q with : 
(21)                                                                                   

  

 q' = q

 (22)																																																												
	(23)																																																																																	

 M' = Lo M tLo + λC tP tLo − λ Lo PtC

																																																																									  

 P' = λ Lo P

	

 
If we are satisfied with this subgroup, we obtain the constancy of this electric charge. But in 
reference  [8],  the  author  decides  to  rely  on  the  orthochronous  isometry  subgroup,  of 
dimension 15, with its two connected components. The action of the group reveals, in addition 
to the scalar q, a quadrivector Q. But this is the equivalent of the passage f, which appeared 
in the Poincaré group. Like the latter, it is cancelled out when we opt for a coordinate system 
linked to the particle. It is therefore not a characteristic of motion, a relevant attribute of 
momentum.  
 
In 4D, the Lorentz group can be interpreted as the “group of hyperbolic rotations in 4D space”. 
As such, it preserves the length of the energy-impulse quadrivector P : 
 
(24)                                                               
 
In the same way, we can consider that the group represents “hyperbolic rotations in 5D”.  
Consider the pentavector:  
 

 PtG P = E2 − p2c2

  

(25)

The Group's action maintains its length: 
 
(26)                                                                
 
But in approach [8], these transformations no longer a priori preserve the electric charge q, 
which then becomes dependent on the chosen coordinate system.  In reference [8], taking up 
the approach initiated in [6], the author opts for a closed fifth dimension, in which the radius 
of  this  “universe  tube”  becomes  very  small,  of  the  order  of  Planck's  length.  He  then 
rediscovers the invariance of electric charge and concludes [8], we quote

By introducing numerical values, this characteristic length is 3.782 10-32 cm. Dividing by 2p 
gives us the order of magnitude of Planck's length. In this view, the quantization of electric 
charge and its constancy are derived from the closure of the extra dimension associated with 
the decrease in the characteristic dimension associated with it.  
 
This  group  refers  to  an  extension  of  Poincaré's  group,  i.e.  to  a  field-free,  curvature-free 
universe. This construction of a five-dimensional relativity was suggested in 1964 in reference 
[6] and has been taken up again more recently in [8]. Note that it is in [6], page 413, that the 
link between charge conjugation and fifth-dimensional inversion is first mentioned.  
 
By  generalizing  [9],  we  can  envisage  an  extension  of  space-time  to  a  space  with  4  +  p 
dimensions, all of which may see their characteristic dimensions reduced, like that of this fifth 
dimension,  each  of  these  collapses  leading  to  the  emergence  and  quantization  of  new 
quantum numbers, baryonic, leptonic, unique etc., the electric charge being only the first of 
these.

If we extend the group from the restricted Poincaré group and its orthochronous subgroup, 
the isometry group of this 4 + p-dimensional space is written as : 
 

(31)

The  closure  and  shortening  of  the  characteristic  lengths  associated  with  the  additional  p 
dimensions leads to quantization and constancy of the resulting quantum numbers. If the 
basic  group  is  the  orthochronous  restricted  Poincaré  group,  the  number  of  related 
components remains limited to two.  In passing, we can return to a simplified formulation 
where  the  group  extension  of  is  limited  to  p  translations  along  p  additional  dimensions, 
ensuring the constancy of the p quantum charges that result:

6 – Topology of the Janus model. 
 
Let's consider a universe closed in all its dimensions, including space and time. We then have 
the 2D didactic image below, that of a sphere S2 : 
 

10 

Fig.1 : 2D didactic image of a closed universe 

 

 
Diametrically opposed, antipodal points can be brought into coincidence. The image is then 
that of a P2 projective. The north and south poles, one representing the Big Bang and the 
other  the  Big  Crunch,  come  into  coincidence.  The  sphere  cannot  be  paved  without  the 
presence of these two singularities. The same applies to any sphere S2n if n is even, especially 
if this dimension is 4. This geometry was proposed in [10].  
 
The  following  figure  shows  how  this  coincidence  of  antipodal  regions  generates  this  T-
symmetry. On the S2 sphere, the direction of time is given by the orientation of the meridian 
curves. This orientation is shown on the left at the new state of maximum expansion, when 
space is identified with the sphere's equator. During this folding of the S2 sphere, described 
in reference [11], the vicinity of this equator is configured as the two-folds cover of a Möbius 
strip with three half-turns. See figure on the right. 

Fig.2 : How the coincidence of antipodal regions creates T-symmetry 

 

 

 

 

In the figure below, we evoke the appearance of T-symmetry by manipulating the vicinity of a 
meridian line. In addition, we evoke the possible elimination of the Big Bang - Big Crunch 
double singularity by replacing them with a tubular passage, which then gives this geometry 
the nature of the two-fold lcover of a Klein bottle. 
 
 

11 

 

Fig.3 : Coincidence of antipodal regions on a sphere S2, according to the two-folds cover of a 
half-turn Möbius strip, with the appearance of T-symmetry.   
 
For enantiomorphy and P-symmetry to appear, the operation would have to be performed on 
a larger sphere. This aspect can be highlighted by considering the conjunction of antipodal 
regions in the vicinity of a meridian line, which is then configured according to the two-sheet 
covering  of  a  half-turn  Möbius  strip.  The  following  figure  illustrates  this  enantiomorphic 
situation.  
 
 

Fig.3 : P-symmetry as a consequence of contacting antipodal region neighborhoods on an S2 

 

sphere. 

 

 

 

 

12 

By  bringing  the  antipodal  points  of  even-dimensional  spheres  into  coincidence,  we  locally 
create a configuration associating two T-symmetrical sheets. By adding further dimensions, 
the coincidence of the antipodes creates a two-sheet CPT-symmetric coating configuration of 
a projective space. In the case of the sphere S2, which corresponds only to a 2D didactic image, 
the image of the projective P2 is its immersion in , which corresponds to the surface described 
in 1903 by the German mathematician Werner Boy [12]. See next figure. 
 

 

 

Fig.4 : Boy's surface, immersion of the P2 projective in 

  !3

 . 

 
In this figure, we show how the coincidence of the antipodal points of the equator of the 
sphere S2 gives the two-sheet covering of a Möbius ribbon with three half-turns.  
In this section, we show that the P and T symmetries invoked by A. Sakharov can be manifested 
as consequences of a purely topological structure, the covering of a projective P4. 
 
 
7 – First attempt to introduce negative masses into the model. 
 
Using dynamical group theory, we showed that this T-symmetry was synonymous with the 
introduction  of  negative  masses  into  the  cosmological  model.  A.Sakharov's  primordial 
antimatter  would  therefore  be  endowed  with  negative  mass.  This  first  step  is  far  from 
anecdotal since, if we neglect it, we admit to losing nothing less than half the universe from 
the outset. Is it then possible to introduce negative masses into the standard model of general 
relativity?  
 
A first idea would be to consider that the field comes from two sources, represented by two 
tensors,  the  first  referring  to  a  positive  mass  content  and  the  second  to  a  negative  mass 
content:  
 

                                              

Rµν −
 

1

R gµν = χ Tµν

(+) + Tµν
(−)

⎡⎣

 

⎤⎦

(39)

We can then consider the metric solution corresponding to a region where the field is created, 
firstly by a positive mass content : 

Rµν −
(40)                                                          
 
 
Geodesics are given by a solution in the form of an external metric: : 
 

R gµν = χTµν

The geodesics evoke an attraction.

Fig.5 Geodesics created by a positive mass. 

 

 

In this context, our single field equation provides only a single family of geodesics, which the 
test particles, with both positive and negative masses, must follow. We deduce that :  
 

- Positive masses attract both positive and negative masses. 

 
Now consider the field created by a negative mass M(-):  
 

(42)                                                        
 
The solution then corresponds to the metric :

The geodesics then represent a repulsion: 
 

 

 

 

14 

Fig.6 Geodesics created by negative mass. 

 

 
 
We deduce that :  
 

- Negative masses repel both positive and negative masses. 

- 

 
This result was illustrated in 1957 by H. Bondi [13]. If two masses of identical absolute values 
but opposite signs are brought together, the positive mass flees, pursued by the negative 
mass. Both then accelerate uniformly, but without any energy input, since the energy of the 
negative mass is itself negative. This phenomenon is known as runaway. What's more, this 
scheme violates the action-reaction principle. In 1957, the conclusion was reached that it was 
physically impossible to include negative masses in the cosmological model. This would only 
be possible at the price of a profound paradigmatic shift, not by denying the achievements of 
general relativity, but by considering its extension in a wider geometric context. 
On en déduit que :  
 

Les  masses  négatives  repoussent  aussi  bien  les  masses  positives  que  les  masses 
négatives. 
 

 
8 – A paradigm shift to escape the crisis of today's cosmology. 
 
n the mid-1970s, the excessive rotation speeds of stars in galaxies had already led specialists 
to propose the existence of dark matter, ensuring their cohesion. In 2011, the discovery that 
the cosmic expansion was accelerating was attributed to a new, unknown ingredient known 
as dark energy. Over the decades, all attempts to assign an identity to these new components 
ended in failure. 
 
In 2017 [14] Hélène Courtois, Daniel Pomarède, Brent Tully and Yeudi Hoffman produced the 
first  very-large-scale  mapping  of  the  universe,  in  a  cube  one  and  a  half  billion  light-years 
across, with the Milky Way, our observation point, at the center. By subtracting the radial 
component  of  the  velocity  linked  to  the  expansion  motion,  they  indicate  the  trajectories 
followed by the masses.  A dipolar structure appears. One formation, the Shapley attractor, 
comprising hundreds of thousands of galaxies, attracts galaxies to itself. But, symmetrically to 
this formation, 600 million light-years from the Milky Way, there is an immense void, some 
one hundred million light-years across, which, on the contrary, repels galaxies, and to which 

 

15 

we give the name of dipole repeller. To date, no theory has been able to explain the existence 
of this vast void. While the idea of a gap in dark matter, positive and attractive, has been 
evoked, it doesn't hold water, as no mechanism has been found to give rise to it. Since 2017, 
several other such voids have been detected and located. 
 

Fig.7 : The dipole repeller 

 

 
The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope has only added to this crisis [15]. The Standard 
Model  LCDM  proposes  a  hierarchical  mechanism  for  the  birth  of  stars  and  galaxies. 
Gravitational instability appears as soon as matter and radiation are decoupled. The scenarios 
for the formation of both stars and galaxies in this model make use of the attributes conferred 
on hypothetical dark matter.   But even with these parameters, it's impossible to imagine 
galaxies forming before a billion years. The Hubble Space Telescope was already able to obtain 
images in the near infrared. Early images of distant objects appeared to show groups of mini-
galaxies. But the James Webb telescope showed that these objects were nothing other than 
HII regions belonging to barred spiral galaxies, fully formed, hosting old stars, only 500 million 
years old. 
 
For decades, the Standard Model has relied on its ability to account for CMB fluctuations as 
gravito-acoustic oscillations, by adapting the numerous parameters relating to dark matter, 
dark  energy  and,  in  particular,  the  value  of  the  Hubble  constant.  This  desire  to  match 
observational  data  has  resulted  in  a  Hubble  constant  value  of  67  kms-1Mpc-1.  This  is 
significantly  lower  than  the  value  of  70  kms-1Mpc-1  deduced  from  direct  observation  of 
standard candles. 
 
All these factors are creating a deep crisis within the specialist community, and some voices 
are beginning to be heard, suggesting the need to consider a profound paradigm shift. This is 
what the Janus cosmological model proposes. 
 
Since  we  are  unable  to  introduce  negative  masses  into  the  general  relativity  model,  let's 
consider a profound change of geometric paradigm, already evoked in the previous sections 
under the aspect of group theory and topology. The motion of positive masses, immersed in 
the gravitational field, takes place according to geodesics that we consider to be derived from

A theoretical model is of no interest if it cannot be compared with observational data. The 
evolution of the positive species will correspond to an acceleration if the energy E of the 
system is negative. This provides a physical interpretation of the acceleration of the cosmic 
expansion  ([16],  [17]),  which  then  follows  from  the  fact  that  the  energy  content  is 
predominantly negative. Numerical data have been successfully compared with observational 
data [18]. The corresponding curve is shown below.

- Masses of the same sign attract each other 

- Masses of opposite signs repel each other. 

 

 
We have thus eliminated the runaway effect.  
 
The first conclusion to be drawn is that where one of the two types of mass is present, the 
other is absent, as immediately confirmed by simulations [19]. This is the case in the vicinity 
of the Sun, and under these conditions the first equation is identified with Einstein's 1915 
equation. The model is therefore in line with all the classical local observational data of general 
relativity:  Mercury's  perihelion  advance,  deflection  of  light  rays  by  the  Sun.    The  model 

 

21 

therefore does not invalidate that of general relativity, but presents itself as its extension, 
made essential to integrate the new observational data, which can no longer be managed by 
introducing the hypothetical components of dark matter and dark energy.   
 
We have seen, in our construction of the unsteady solution, that negative energy dominates. 
The model is thus profoundly asymmetrical. Negative mass content will now replace the dark 
matter + dark energy pair. By the way, going back to the original idea, inspired by the work of 
Andrei Sakharov, this allows us to attribute a well-defined identity to these components. They 
are invisible, insofar as negative masses emit photons of negative energy that our optical 
instruments cannot capture. They are therefore simply copies of our own antimatter, assigned 
a negative mass. We then have a new distribution of contents:  
 

 

 

 

Fig.9 : Comparative contents of the LCDM and Janusus models :  

 
At the moment of decoupling, when the gravitational instability can play its role (we must then 
speak of joint gravitational instabilities), the characteristic Jeans time is shorter for negative 
masses:

The  result  will  be  a  regular  distribution  of  negative-mass  conglomerates  of  spheroidal 
antihydrogen and negative-mass antihelium. These will behave like immense negative-mass 
protostars. As soon as their temperature causes hydrogen reionization, their contraction will 
cease.  These  formations  will  then  radiate  in  the  red  and  infrared  wavelengths.  But  their 
cooling time is then large compared to the age of the universe, which means that these objects 
will no longer evolve. The history of this negative world is totally different from our own. It 
will not give rise to stars, galaxies or planets. It will contain no atoms heavier than negative-
mass antihelium. And there will be no life. And, as we'll see later: these negative formations 
are deliberately situated within the Newtonian approximation. 
 
But there's another very important point. When these spheroidal conglomerates form, they 
confine the positive mass to the residual space, giving it a lacunar structure, comparable to 
joined  soap  bubbles.  The  negative  mass  is  thus  distributed  in  the  form  of  thin  plates, 

22 

 

sandwiched between two negative conglomerates that exert a strong back pressure on it. The 
positive  mass  is  thus  violently  compressed  and  heated.  However,  due  to  its  plate-like 
arrangement, it can cool down very quickly through the emission of radiation..   
 
 

Fig.10 : Early rapid star and galaxy formation.  

 
The result is a pattern of first-generation star and galaxy formation totally different from the 
standard  one.  This  configuration  had  been  the  subject  of  simulations  [19]  since  the  first, 
heuristic, approach to the model, and the fact that objects all form within the first hundred 
million years was one of its predictions, largely confirmed by JWST data.  
 
The  lacunar  structure,  advocated  as  early  as  1995,  predicted  the  existence  of  large  voids, 
which the discoveries of the dipole repeller and other similar large voids have also confirmed.  
 
Once this lacunar structure has been formed, matter tends to concentrate along the segments 
common to three gaps, forming filaments.  The nodes of this distribution will only develop 
into galaxy clusters.

12 – The problem of the model's mathematical consistency. 
 
This is ensured in an isotropic, homogeneous and unsteady situation, the required condition 
being the generalized conservation of energy expressed by equation (53). We now turn to the 
case of stationary solutions, limiting ourselves to those that satisfy SO(3) symmetry. Bianchi 
conditions must then be satisfied, i.e. relations (58), (60), (62),(63).  
 
First,  we'll  show  the  existence  of  asymptotic  consistency  in  Newtonian  approximation 
situations. Let's recall its various aspects. 
 
- Velocities must be negligible compared to the speed of light. This is the case for velocities 
 < v >
 of thermal agitation in both media, which are involved in the definition of 
pressures and in both media. After decoupling :

 and

ε p = ε ρ< v2 >

(66)                                       
 
- Curvature effects must be neglected. We translate this by saying that the values of the radial 
coordinate  must  be  large  in  front  of  the  length  characterizing  curvature  effects,  i.e.  the 
Schwarzschild radius

 ds 2 = eνdx°2 − eλdr2 − r2dθ2 − r2 sin2 θdϕ2

The construction of a stationary solution then requires to calculate the functions :  
 

    

 ν(r), λ(r),ν(r),λ(r)

 

 
To locate this solution, we need to consider the shapes of the field source tensors: 
 
T µ
ν , t µ
(69)                                                                 
 
 
Let's start by considering a situation where only positive mass is present. The tensors 
T µ
 
 

 are then zero. The form of the tensor

As we're in the Newtonian approximation,

(68a) and the tensor (70) in the first field equation we are led to introduce the function m(r) 
such that : 

ε

(71)                                                                   
 
The classic calculation then leads to the relationship:  
 

e−λ = 1−

m(r) = 2 4πG r3ρ

We then obtain the TOV equation (Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff). Relation (72) places the 
small quantity in front of any quantity that will be neglected in the Newtonian approximation.:

equivalent to that exerted by the mass located at the center of the sphere, and that the mass 

located outside this sphere gives a force of zero. So the quantity 

 is the force of 

gravity, per unit volume, acting on the matter contained in an elementary volume around a 
point at distance r from the center. Thus the relation (70), which follows from the Newtonian 
approximation, expresses that the force of gravity balances the force of pressure. This is the 
classic Euler relationship.  
 
To ensure the mathematical consistency of the system of two field equations, we therefore 
need to consider a form of the tensor 
 that gives back this same Euler relation when the 
Newtonian approximation is also applied to this solution. This is guaranteed with the form :

tending towards zero.

conditions satisfy the Newtonian approximation.

The expressions are similar, but the signs of the pressure terms are reversed. This is due to 
the  desire  to  find,  in  Newtonian  approximation,  the  equivalent  of  Euler's  equation  in  the 
object of negative mass, meaning that within it, pressure forms balance the force of gravity. 
For an observer made up of the same type of matter, this negative matter would behave in 
exactly the same way as our own. The change in sign is due to the presence of a minus sign in 
the second member of the second field equation.  
 
Under these conditions, the second equation generates its own “TOV” equation: 
 

(78)                                

= −

dp
dr

= −

( ρ − ε p / c 2 )( m − 4πεG pr3 / c 4 ) c 2

r( r + 2εG m / c 2 )

 
Once again, by tending to zero or, what amounts to the same thing, by tending 
these two equations can be identified with the Euler equation.  
 

The asymptotic consistency of the Newtonian approximation is clearly restored.

13 – Dipole repeller prediction. 
 
The  Janus  model  is  essentially  falsifiable  in  Popper's  sense.  It  predicted  a  large-scale  twin 
structure with large voids. This has been confirmed. It predicted a very early birth of first-
generation  stars  and  galaxies.  Also  confirmed.  A  new  prediction  this  time  concerns  the 
magnitude of sources located in the background of the large void. According to the model, the 
magnitude of the light emitted by these distant sources will be attenuated by negative lensing. 
This is a novel aspect, since it has been assumed that the two entities, positive and negative, 
interact only through antigravitation. Photons from these distant sources can then freely pass 
through  the  negative-mass  conglomerates.  This  means  that  both  external  and  internal 
geodesics must be used. The deflection effect of light rays will be greatest when they graze 
the surface of the object, with radius . This effect weakens as you move deeper into the object, 
becoming zero when the photons pass through its center..

Eventually, we'll be able to map the magnitudes of objects in the background of the dipole 
repeller. Schematically, their luminosity will be attenuated in a ring-shaped formation.:

This measurement will immediately give us the value of the radius
 
 
14- ABeyond the Newtonian approximation..  
 
These objects are absent in the negative world. In the positive world, objects that deviate from 
the  Newtonian  approximation  are  neutron  stars  and  hypermassive  objects  located  at  the 
center of galaxies, which early images show to be the seat of a strong gravitational redshift 
effect, darkening their central part. These objects are a priori manageable using the classic 
pair of outer and inner metrics, taking rotation into account. It should be remembered that 
we are under no obligation to provide the form of the source tensor of the other sector, in 
this  case  an  interaction  tensor,  whose  form  would  be  precisely  imposed  by  the  Bianchi 
condition. It's conceivable that one day someone will provide the exact form of this tensor.  
 

But even in the absence of such an object, there is no a priori inconsistency. 

 
 
15 – Conclusion. 
 
The genesis of the Janus model spanned several decades. The starting point in 1965 was the 
attempt by the Russian Andrei Sakharov to provide the beginnings of an explanation for the 
absence of observations of primordial antimatter, which remains a major flaw in the Standard 
Model,  which  provides  no  explanation  for  such  loss  of  half  the  universe's  content.    He 
therefore suggested a universe structure with two sectors, the second being T-symmetrical to 
our  own.  A  few  years  later,  in  1970,  as  an  application  of  symplectic  geometry,  the 
mathematician Jean-Marie Souriau showed that this inversion of the time coordinate, this T-
symmetry,  is  synonymous  with  the  inversion  of  energy  and  mass.    Taking  this  desire  to 
reconstitute  global  symmetry  a  step  further,  Sakharov  envisaged  what  he  called  a  twin 
universe  as  CPT-symmetrical  with  our  own.  In  this  view,  the  invisible  components  of  the 
universe boil down to negative-mass antimatter. In 1994, we suggested that this universe 
structure corresponds to the two folds cover of a projective P4 by a compact universe with 
the topology of an S4 sphere. The two singularities of this spherical universe, the Big Bang and 

30 

the  Big  Crunch,  then  coincide.  By  substituting  a  tubular  structure,  these  singularities 
disappears. This configuration combines two PT-symmetrical sheets. These adjacent sectors 
are assumed to interact exclusively through gravity. The interaction between positive masses 
and  negative  masses  in  the  other  sector  must  therefore  be  considered.  However,  the 
introduction of negative masses is impossible within the framework of general relativity, as it 
would  lead  to  interaction  laws  that  are  incompatible  with  physics.  A  bimetric  model  is 
therefore envisaged. A system of coupled field equations is then constructed from an action. 
Its form eliminates the unmanageable runaway effect. The model's interaction laws are such 
that masses of the same sign attract each other according to Newton's law, while masses of 
opposite signs repel each other according to anti-Newton's law. As these masses are mutually 
exclusive, the negative mass can be neglected in the vicinity of the Sun, and the first field 
equation is then identified with Einstein's equation. In this way, the model is consistent with 
local relativistic observations, such as the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the deflection 
of light rays by the Sun. The model is therefore an extension of the general relativity model. 
An exact, unsteady solution is constructed, revealing a generalized energy conservation law, 
extended to both sectors. Adaptation of the model to observations, revealing an acceleration 
of the expansion, then imposes a total dissymmetry between the two entities in presence. The 
vast majority of negative mass replaces the hypothetical components of dark matter and dark 
energy.  The  result  is  a  distribution  of  4%  visible  matter  and  96%  negative  mass,  invisible 
because it emits photons of negative energy that escape our observation instruments. This 
dissymmetry means that, after decoupling, the negative masses form a regular network of 
spheroidal conglomerates, while the positive mass, confined to the remaining space, adopts 
a patchy distribution. The model accounts for the existence of large voids, the dipole repeller 
having been The model accounts for the existence of large voids, the dipole repeller having 
been  the  first  of  these.  At  the  center  of  these  large  voids  are  invisible  spheroidal 
conglomerates, behaving like gigantic protostars, with a cooling time greater than the age of 
the universe. These objects, which emit negative-energy photons corresponding to light in the 
red and infrared regions, do not evolve, nor do they give rise to stars, galaxies or atoms heavier 
than helium. Life is therefore absent from this negative sector, which is made up of a mixture 
of negative-mass antihydrogen and antihelium. The model also accounts for the very early 
birth  of  first-generation  stars  and  galaxies,  as  recently  demonstrated  by  the  James  Webb 
telescope.  We  then  examine  the  question  of  the  model's  mathematical  consistency,  i.e. 
whether  the  Bianchi  conditions  are  satisfied.  We  show  that  these  can  be  asymptotically 
satisfied under conditions corresponding to the Newtonian approximation. We then settle the 
question of objects that don't fit into this approximation, essentially located on the positive 
side, by simply pointing out that we are under no obligation to provide the exact form of the 
interaction tensor, which is then determined by the zero divergence condition, and that the 
lack of definition of this tensor in no way invalidates the consistency of a non-linear solution.
