Abstract	:	After	having	evoked	the	deep	crisis	that	cosmology	and	physics	know,	we	
examine	the	different	attempts	to	introduce	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	model.	
Only	the	Janus	cosmological	model	presents	both	a	mathematical	and	physical	
coherence,	as	well	as	numerous	observational	confirmations.	Presenting	itself	as	a	
geometrical	extension	of	general	relativity,	it	represents	a	possible	solution	to	the	crisis	
of	cosmology.	
____________________________________________________________________________________________________	
1	-	Introduction	:	
Physics	and	cosmology	have	been	in	perfect	crisis	since	1970.	In	2006	the	physicist	Lee	
Smolin	published	a	book	entitled	"The	trouble	with	physics"	[1]	the	same	year	Peter	
Woit	published	"Not	even	wrong!	"	[2].	Between	1900	and	1970	theoretical	physics,	
experimental	 physics	 and	 observational	 techniques	 progressed	 hand	
in	 hand.	
Sometimes	the	experiment	or	the	observation	raised	a	question	to	which	theorists	then	
answered,	possibly	by	introducing	a	profound	paradigm	shift	in	our	way	of	conceiving	
space,	time,	matter,	the	universe.	Sometimes	the	theoretical	models	were	ahead	of	the	
observation,	as	it	was	the	case	with	the	prediction	of	the	existence	of	antimatter	by	Dirac.	
Through	an	anecdote,	we	can	evoke	the	fact	that	theoretical	advances	were	sometimes	
received	with	irony.	Thus	Niels	Bohr	had	said,	after	this	announcement	made	by	Dirac,	
that	“this	theory	was	good	for	capturing	elephants.	Dirac's	theory	is	hung	on	a	tree	in	
Africa.	The	elephants	read	it	and	are	so	flabbergasted	that	they	can	be	easily	captured”.	
In	the	sixties,	cosmology,	where	a	large	consensus	had	been	reached,	which	translated	
into	the	idea	that	the	cosmological	constant	should	be	either	zero	or	negligible,	was	
practically	reduced	to	the	measurement	of	the	density	of	the	universe,	by	comparing	it	
to	a	critical	density	of	10-29	grams	per	cubic	centimeter.	Depending	on	the	case,	one	
chose	one	of	the	three	models	derived	from	Friedmann's	solutions.		
The	theory	of	quarks	had	allowed	the	emergence	of	a	standard	model	whose	elegance	
and	coherence	were	admired.	Particle	physics	added	new	members	to	the	bestiary	with	
supersymmetry	but,	all	of	a	sudden,	Nature	refused	to	confirm	these	predictions.	The	
new	superparticles	did	not	appear.	The	crisis	spread	to	cosmology	and	astrophysics.	The	
dynamics	of	galaxies	and	the	observed	strong	gravitational	lensing	effects	could	no

longer	work	with	visible	matter.	We	had	to	conjecture	the	existence	of	another	one,	of	
unknown	nature,	to	which	we	gave	the	word	dark	matter.	But	for	the	moment	it	is	only	a	
name,	hiding	our	ignorance.	To	explain	the	extraordinary	homogeneity	of	the	primitive	
universe,	it	was	considered	that	the	universe	could	have	undergone	an	extremely	brutal	
expansion	phase,	under	the	effect	of	the	field,	immediately	associated	with	a	new	
particle:	the	inflaton.	But	today	there	are	as	many	models	of	inflatons	as	there	are	
researchers	working	on	this	subject.		
As	if	this	problem	was	not	enough,	the	evidence	of	the	acceleration	of	the	cosmic	
expansion	required	that	we	consider	a	new	form	of	energy,	also	black.	
The	years	pass.	All	attempts	to	identify	these	components,	as	important	by	their	effects	
as	mysterious	by	their	nature,	were	failures.		
If	it	takes	years	before	we	can	give	an	identity	to	all	these	unknown	components,	can	we	
really	speak	of	a	standard	cosmological	model?		
For	forty	years,	string	theory	seemed	to	represent	a	new	paradigm	shift.	Historically,	it	
will	undoubtedly	be	an	interlude	one	day.	After	a	short	period	of	skepticism,	the	
majority	of	theorists	threw	themselves	into	the	adventure,	which	gave	the	opportunity	
to	publish	thousands	of	articles	and	to	present	hundreds	of	theses.	But	when	one	builds	
a	model	it	is	still	desirable	that	it	proposes	explanations	of	phenomena,	or	predicts	them.	
Half	a	century	later,	one	conclusion	is	obvious.	String	theory	is	no	more	than	a	
mathematical	gesticulation4.	
In	their	books	Smolin	and	Woit	called	for	the	emergence	of	new	ideas5.		In	what	follows	
we	propose	to	study	the	benefit	and	cost	of	introducing	particles	with	negative	masses	
and	energies	into	the	model.	
	2	–	Attempts	to	introduce	negative	masses	in	cosmology.		
	The	main	article	appeared	in	1957	[5].	The	author	introduces	then	two	types	of	masses,	
inertial	and	gravitational,	which	are	identified	in	General	Relativity6.			Any	attempt	to	
introduce	these	negative	masses	in	the	General	Relativity	model	is	then	confronted	with	
the	runaway	phenomenon,	which	can	be	summarized	in	these	two	sentences:		
	
-	Positive	masses	attract	all	types	of		masses	
-	Negative	masses	repel	all	types	of	masses.		
																																																									
4	But	the	four	representatives	of	theoretical	physics	at	the	Advanced	Studies	Institute	of	
Princeton,	to	which	Einstein	and	Kurt	Gödel	belonged,	are	string	specialists.	Because	
there	is	....	nobody	else.	
5	Smolin	only	saw	a	justification	for	launching	a	"quantum	gravitation"	where	space	and	
time	themselves	would	be	quantized.	But	for	the	moment,	it	doesn't	work.	Probably	
because	the	approach	considered	(Carlo	Rovelli)	is	not	the	right	one.	Apart	from	that,	
Smolin	refused	any	other	approach,	refusing	to	answer	to	our	mailings,	transmitted	by	
the	mathematician	Alain	Connes,	Field	medalist	and	preface	of	his	work.

Under	these	conditions,	if	two	masses	of	opposite	signs	are	brought	together,	the	
negative	mass	runs	away,	pursued	by	the	positive	mass.	In	this	phenomenon	of	mutual	
acceleration,	energy	is	conserved	since	the	kinetic	energy	of	the	negative	mass	is	
negative.	A	physicist	can	hardly	imagine	that	such	a	behavior	could	be	part	of	a	new	
physics.	This	article	provokes	some	comments	([6]-[12]).		
	Years	later,	this	possibility	is	again	considered	[13]	,	without	any	more	success.	Let	us	
quote	the	author's	conclusion	:	
	
Indeed,	what	I	am	writing	may	be	called	science	fantasy,	and	the	busy	reader	is	fully	
entitled	to	turn	the	page.	My	reason	for	continuing	is	to	see	whether	the	properties	of	
the	hypothetical	universe	suggest	why	the	real	universe	contains	only	positive	mass.	My	
intention	is	summarized	by	Einstein’s	metaphorical	phrase	:	«	“What	interests	me	is	
whether	God	had	choice	in	the	creation	of	the	world”	».		
	For	the	sake	of	completeness,	let	us	quote	two	other	attempts,	one	in	string	theory	[29]	
and	the	other	in	a	more	classical	approach	[30],	but	where	the	essential	paradigmatic	
leap,	the	passage	to	a	system	of	two	coupled	field	equations,	is	not	made,	so	that	the	
authors	run	up	against	the	runaway	paradox,	inevitable	for	any	attempt	to	introduce	
negative	masses	into	the	Einstein	equation.				
	
Still	trying	to	introduce	these	negative	masses	into	General	Relativity,	i.e.,	into	Einstein's	
field	equation,	we	find	the	suggestion	that	the	negative	energy	of	these	masses	could	
mimic	the	cosmological	constant	[14].	But,	under	these	conditions	the	density	of	the	
latter	must	remain	constant	during	the	cosmic	evolution.	The	author	then	suggests	a	
mechanism	of	continuous	creation	of	these	negative	masses,	not	described,	which	does	
not	clarify	the	problem.		
	There	are	then	heuristic	attempts7	[15]	in	which	the	following	interaction	laws	are	given,	
free	of	theoretical	justifications.		
	-	Masses	of	the	same	sign	attract	each	other	according	to	Newton's	law	
-	Masses	of	opposite	signs	repel	each	other	according	to	"anti-Newton".		
	Such	a	heuristic	model	is	equivalent	to	restoring	the	principles	of	action-reaction	and	
equivalence	in	this	set	of	masses.	By	taking	densities	and	temperatures	equal	in	absolute	
value	for	the	two	entities,	one	obtains	then	a	phenomenon	of	percolation	(see	Fig.	1).		
	

																																																								
7	Heuristic	approach:	we	formulate	a	hypothesis	on	the	interaction	laws,	without	
theoretical	justifications,	and	we	look	at	what	results	from	it,	through	numerical	
simulations.

	It	is	seen	that	the	two	types	of	masses	tend	to	separate,	giving	a	pattern	that	does	not	
seem	to	be	able	to	be	connected	to	any	astronomical	observation.	This	1990	result8	was	
based	on	250	positive	and	250	negative	mass	points.		Seeing	this	result	we	had	the	idea	
to	give	the	negative	points	a	mass	of	an	order	of	magnitude	greater	than	that	of	the	
positive	points.	The	effect	of	this	heuristic	approach	was	immediate.	The	negative	
masses	immediately	formed	a	regular	network	of	clusters,	confining	the	positive	mass	in	
the	residual	space.	(see	Fig.	2	and	Fig.	3).

		This	suggested	that	the	key	to	the	large-scale	structure	of	the	universe	could	arise	from	a	
very	dissymmetric	situation.	Moreover,	the	fact	that	positive	masses	were	the	first	to	
give	rise	to	clusters	could	be	explained	by	the	fact	that	the	Jeans	time	associated	with	
them	was	then	lower	:

joined	soap	bubbles	(see	Fig.	4).

Fig.4	:	The	joint	soap	bubbles	model	

	
	
	
At	the	center	of	each	cell,	there	is	a	cluster	of	negative	mass.	Three	cells	meet	along	a	
segment,	likely,	still	by	gravitational	instability,	to	give	rise	to	a	filamentary	structure.	
Four	cells	meet	along	a	point	in	the	vicinity	of	which	we	will	then	have	a	cluster	of	
galaxies.	At	the	moment	of	the	constitution	of	this	structure	on	a	very	large	scale,	the	
matter	is	brutally	compressed	according	to	plates,	which	allow	a	rapid	radiative	cooling,	
destabilizing,	generating	the	birth	of	galaxies.		
	This	idea	is	reinforced	by	the	discovery,	in	2017,	of	the	Dipole	Repeller	phenomenon	
[16].	A	cluster	of	negative	mass,	occupying	the	center	of	this	great	void,	is	then	
responsible	for	the	effect	of	repulsion	produced,	on	the	neighboring	galaxies.		
	
Another	observational	aspect	lends	credence	to	this	model	of	large-scale	structure	of	the	
universe.	We	know	that	galaxies	with	high	redshift9	(	z	>	7	)	have	very	low	luminosities.	
They	are	then	considered	as	dwarfs.	This	model	provides	a	different	interpretation:	
objects	of	negative	mass,	producing	on	photons	of	positive	energy	a	negative	
gravitational	lensing	[17],	[18]),	it	would	be	galaxies	of	a	normal	size	whose	luminosity	
would	be	attenuated	by	this	phenomenon.	Combining	these	two	aspects,	finer	
measurements	of	attenuation	of	this	luminosity	of	the	galaxies	in	the	background	would	
then	provide	an	assessment	of	the	size	of	the	object.		
		3	–	Towards	a	new	model	based	on	a	new	geometric	paradigm.		
	It	is	clear	that	if	we	stay	in	the	geometrical	framework	proposed	by	Einstein,	where	the	
trajectories	of	masses	and	photons	are	interpreted	as	metric	solutions10	
	of	a	single	
field	equation,	the	runaway	phenomenon	is	inevitable.	The	only	way	to	escape	this

paradox,	hardly	acceptable	to	a	physicist,	is	to	consider	that	the	trajectories	of	positive	
masses	and	photons	of	positive	energy	on	the	one	hand,	and	of	negative	masses	and	
photons	of	negative	energy	on	the	other	hand,	are	deduced	from	two	different	metrics	
.	This	leads	to	a	new	geometrical	model	where	the	single	𝑀!	manifold11	is	
equipped	with	not	one,	but	two	metric	fields12.	The	first	attempt	in	this	direction	
presents	this	situation	as	resulting	from	the	interaction	between	two	“branes”.	In	this	
model	the	elements	of	the	two	populations	are	supposed	to	interact	through	gravitons	of	
non-zero	mass	([19],[20]).	This	non-zero	mass	of	the	gravitons13	means	that	this	model	
also	belongs	to	the	 massive	 gravity,	and	is	thus	presented	as	 a	 massive	 bigravity.	An	
assumption	which	only	complicates	the	model,	by	giving	birth	to	the	classical	ghost	
instability14.	Hereafter	the	action15	corresponding	to	this	model:

Any	point	of	the	first	branch,	the	“right”	branch,	marked	by	the	letter	R	,	is	interacting	
with	a	conjugate	point	of	the	second	branch,	the	“left”	branch,	marked	by	the	letter	L	.		
	and		
They	introduce	Lagrangian	densities	in	the	action	:	the	Ricci	terms	
	and	negative	
	.	All	those	are	based	on	the	corresponding	four-dimensional	
matter	16

14	"Ghost	instability"	which	stems	from	the	fact	that	gravitons	would	contribute	to	the	
gravity	field,	which	makes	the	system	self	unstable	(...).	
15	This	idea	of	"action"	derives	from	the	principle	of	least	action	of	the	Frenchman	Pierre	
de	Maupertuis	(1698-1759).		The	trajectories	are	"optimal"	paths	along	which	the	
integral	defined	by	the	scalar	S	is	minimal.	This	constraint	leads	to	"a	calculation	of	
variation"	(it	is	the	metric,	which	then	becomes	the	unknown).	
16	The	way	of	approaching	the	problem,	which	was	defined	by	David	Hilbert	to	support	
the	empiricist	approach	of	Albert	Einstein,	is	to	compose	the	action	(which	became	the	
"Hilbert-Einstein	action").	It	has	an	undeniable	"kitchen"	side.	In	the	integral	we	put	"the	
Ricci	scalar"	R,	which	is	a	scalar	related	to	the	curvature	of	space.	It	is	zero	if	the	space	is	
flat.	It	is	the	presence	of	this	term	that	gives	the	first	member	of	the	Einstein	equation,	at	
the	end	of	a	"variation	calculation"	(of	the	metric	and	of	the	Ricci	tensor	which	is	
deduced	from	it).	As	there	are	two	Ricci	scalars,	each	attached	to	each	of	these	two	
"geometries",	the	calculation	of	the	variations	will	give	the	first	two	members	of	two	
field	equations.		And	we	add	"Lagrangian	densities".	In	General	Relativity	there	is	only

	based	on	an	“average	volume	factor17”
of	this	paper	is	that	the	Lagrangian	derivation	shows	for	the	first	time	the	form	of	the	
system	of	two	coupled	field	equations,	linked	to	such	a	bimetric	model18:

influenced	by	the	matter	field	of	the	second.	But	their	test	does	not	lead	to	any	model,	
because	they	cannot	specify	the	nature	of	the	interaction	terms20.	
A	more	sophisticated	attempt	[18]	is	based	on	the	action21:

	The	metrics	are	then	marked	with	the	letters	 g	and	 h.	We	find	the	two	Lagrangian

help	of	applications	to	which	she	gives	the	name	“pull	over”.	Her	coupled	field	equations

19	The	"tensor"	formalism	means	that	the	equations	and	solutions	obtained	do	not	
depend	on	the	chosen	coordinate	system.	The	only	invariant	objects	are	the	geodesics	
and	the	lengths	measured	along	them	(think	of	the	S2	sphere).

		The	conservativity	of	the	two	equations,	resulting	from	the	form	of	their	first	two	
members	is	then	ensured.	If	the	mathematical	method	is	rigorous,	the	benefit	that	
results	from	the	approach,	in	terms	of	comparison	with	observations,	derives	from	the	
choice,	obviously	free,	of	the	sign	of	terms	present	in	the	action	(4).	At	the	time	she	
composed	her	article,	in	2008,	the	scientific	community	had	not	yet	agreed	on	the	fact	
that	the	expansion	of	the	universe	is	not	slowed	down,	but	accelerated	([21],[3],[4]).	In	
particular,	her	hypothesis	leads	to	a	violation	of	the	equivalence	principle	in	the	negative	
mass	population,	and	she	concludes	that	this	is	a	generic	property	of	bimetric	models24.	
In	our	unpublished	work25[22]	her	method	is	taken	up	again,	with	different	choices	of	
signs,	restoring	the	principle	of	equivalence	within	this	population	of	negative	mass.	
This	work	represents	then	the	justification	of	the	various	works,	evoked	above,	until	
then	founded	on	a	heuristic	hypothesis.	This	model,	named	Janus	Cosmological	Model	
(JCM),	is	based	on	the	fundamental	assumption	of	a	deep	dissymmetry	between	the	
mass	and	negative	energy	populations	and	the	mass	and	negative	energy	populations.	
Here	is	the	system	of	equations	that	results	from	this	approach,	here	in	mixed	
notation26	:

24	In	order	to	fit	with	the	observational	data	of	the	time,	she	violates	the	equivalence	
principle	of	GR	(equality	between	inertial	mass-the	way	a	particle	behaves	in	a	field-	and	
gravitational	mass-the	way	it	contributes	to	this	field).	In	doing	so,	it	loses	all	the	benefit	
that	the	rigor	of	its	mathematical	approach	gave	it	and	does	not	manage	to	fit	with	
observations				
25	Refusal	of	four	journals	to	simply	submit	this	paper	for	review	by	referees	(or	
admission	of	failure	of	the	journals	to	find	a	referee	willing	to	do	this	analysis	work).	
26	T.	Damour,	in	2019,	believed	he	had	found	a	crippling	flaw	in	this	model,	which	was	
quickly	eliminated	by	tinkering	(the	"hats"),	with	the	second	tensors	of	the	second	
members	that	reflect	"induced	curvature	effects".	This	is	not	a	tinkering	with	the	model.	
In	fact	it	is	the	satisfaction	of	the	"Bianchi	mathematical	conditions"	that	determine	the	
shape	of	these	tensors.	But	he	never	read	our	answer.

	The	interaction	laws	are	derived	from	the	Newtonian	approximation,	and	are	those	that	
were	chosen	heuristically.	The	form	of	the	tensors	responsible	for	the	effects	of	induced	
geometry	is	determined	by	the	conservativity	and	equilibrium	relations	in	the	two	
equations,	derived	from	the	Bianchi	identities.	When	we	study,	for	example,	the	induced	
geometry	of	a	species,	under	the	action	of	the	field	created	by	the	second	species,	
present	in	a	sphere	of	constant	density,	the	relation	simply	translates	the	fact	that	in	this	
mass,	positive	or	negative,	the	pressure	force	balances	the	force	of	gravity	[23].	This	is	
ensured	on	the	tensor	in	the	form:		
(8)		
	
	This	model	is	supported	by	the	numerous	results	having	flowed	from	the	heuristic	
approach:		
	-	Explanation	of	the	confinement	of	galaxies	and	clusters	as	well	as	of	the	flatness	of	the	
rotation	curves	of	galaxies	in	the	periphery.		
	-	Explanation	of	the	strong	gravitational	lensing	effects	in	the	vicinity	of	galaxies	and	
galaxy	clusters.		
	-	Spiral	structure	as	a	result	of	the	interaction	between	galaxies	and	their	negative	mass	
environment.		
	
-	Since	the	two	types	of	masses	are	mutually	exclusive,	the	density	of	negative	mass,	very	
low	in	galaxies,	is	negligible	in	the	neighborhood	of	the	Sun.	The	first	equation	of	the	
system	is	then	identified	with	the	Einstein	equation.	The	local	relativistic	verifications,	
Mercury's	perihelion	advance,	deviation	of	light	rays	by	the	Sun,	is	thus	assured.	
	Beyond	the	construction	of	an	exact	solution,	exploiting	the	dissymmetry	between	the	
two	populations	has	led	to	an	excellent	agreement	with	the	data	from	the	observations	
of	type	Ia	supernovae	[24]	(see	Fig	5).

			4	–	Conclusion.		
	The	question	of	the	introduction	of	negative	masses	has	been	strongly	opposed	by	the	
emergence	of	the	runaway	phenomenon	([5],[13]),	which	is	difficult	to	integrate	in	
physics	and	cosmology.	This	concept	of	negative	mass	has	also	been	invoked	in	a	
reinterpretation	of	some	particle	physics	phenomena	[25].	It	is	mentioned	in	the	string	
theory	[26],	or	in	a	reinterpretation	of	the	geometry	associated	to	the	Schwarzschild	
solution	([27],	[28]).	The	integration	in	a	mathematically	and	physically	coherent	Janus	
cosmological	model,	leading	to	a	large	number	of	observational	confirmations,	makes	
this	approach,	which	implies	a	deep	paradigmatic	leap	concerning	the	geometry	of	the	
universe,	a	solution	to	the	current	crisis	in	cosmology	and	astrophysics.

	Author	elucidates	the	idea	of	negative	mass	in	cosmological	models.	After	the	historical	
review	of	different	attempts	to	explore	this	controversial	idea,	author	states	that	the	so	
called	Janus	Cosmological	Model	(JCM)	is	a	good	candidate	for	the	modeling	of	negative	
mass.	It	is	stressed	that	the	basic	argument	in	favor	of	the	Janus	Cosmological	Model	
comes	out	both	from	the	heuristic	supposition	and	the	definite	observational	
confirmation.	The	major	result	of	the	paper	is	in	detailed	justification	of	various	works	
supporting	the	idea	of	negative	mass	in	cosmology.	The	results	of	this	paper	are	new	and	
physically	interesting.	This	paper,	in	spite	of	some	formal	presentation,	may	be	useful	
for	a	wide	scientific	community	in	view	of	the	fundamental	importance	in	understanding	
the	physical	details	of	cosmological	expansion.	The	manuscript	is	well	organized,	clearly	
written	and	may	be	published	as	it	is.	I	recommend	to	publish	this	paper	in	Frontiers	in	
Physics.

The	introduction	of	negative	masses	in	physics	is	generally	considered	as	a	problem.	
However,	there	are	some	minority	but	authoritative	currents	that	hypothesize	this	
possibility.	The	article	is	an	introductory	review,	and	should	be	commended	for	its	
intellectual	honesty.
