2020 september 16.  The manuscript DW12414 is being processed by PRD 

18 septembre 2020.     Your first rejection : 
Dear Dr. Jean-Pierre, 
We have examined your manuscript and conclude that it is not suited for Physical 
Review D. We make no judgment on the correctness of the work, only on its 
suitability according to our other criteria. 
To be publishable in Physical Review D, manuscripts must contain significant new 
results in physics, be of high quality and scientific interest, and be recognized as an 
important contribution to the literature. 
We do not believe that your paper meets these criteria and feel that it will be more 
productive for you to seek publication in another, more specialized journal. 
Yours sincerely, 
Robert Wimmer 
Associate Editor 
Physical Review D

18 septembre. Our first protest : 
Copy to S.Hossenfeler 

Sir, 

This article is based on a completely new cosmological model, of the highest level in 
cosmology and differential geometry, published in your journal in 2008 by 
S.Hossenfelder under the title : A bimetric Theory with Exchange Symmetry. Phys. 
Rev. D78, 044015, 2008 and arXiv : 0807.2838v1 (gr-qc)17 july 2008

At a time when many articles are being published that are totally speculative, free of 
any observation, the results are important and undeniable. By comparing what 
emerges from this theory explains :   
- The acceleration of cosmic expansion, with excellent agreement with observational 
data from 700 type Ia supernovae 

-	The large-scale structure of the universe where a regular distribution of negative, 

repulsive mass, gives the positive mass, the only visible one, a lacunar structure, 
agreement with the observations.  
- The confinement of galaxies, including the explanation of the flatness 
of  their velocity curves.  
- The strong gravitational lens effects, due to negative gravitational lensing .  
- Accounts for local relativistic effects 
- Gives the first explanation of the recently discovered phenomenon, which in 2017 
was given the name "Great Repeller", by identifying it as a negative mass 
conglomerate, invisible because it emits negative energy photons. A structure for 
which no credible theoretical interpretation has yet been proposed.  
- Provides an alternative interpretation to the low magnitude of redshift 
objects greater than 7.  
- Proposes observations that may give the size of the negative mass 
conglomerate.  
 - Proposes a different scheme of galaxies’ formation, the compression of 
the positive mass, sandwiched between two negative mass conglomerates, 
leading to its heating, followed by a rapid radiative cooling, optimal for a 
plate structure. 
- Finally, it is the first model that imputes the observational effects so far 
attributed to a mysterious dark matter and a no less mysterious dark energy 
by showing that the negative mass content of the universe fully accounts for 
all these effects. A content that is a copy of the classical particles and 
antiparticles, owing a negative mass and energy.  
We ask that our article be reconsidered more seriously. 

________________________________________________________________________________________	

2020 September 24 : Your second rejection    
Dear Dr. Jean-Pierre, 
We have considered your remarks and do not find them to be sufficiently persuasive 
to warrant further consideration of your manuscript. We therefore regret to inform 
you that we stand by our decision against publication of your paper.

2020 September 24.  Our second protest : 
 

Let me mention that the only check and comparison with data caried out in the 
manuscript is the Hubble diagram of Fig. 2. For state of the art cosmology this is the 
absolute minimum and it is completely 
insufficient for the level of today's precision cosmology. 
Yours sincerely, 
Robert Wimmer

  	Dear	Editor,	
		In	the	field	of	astrophysics	and	cosmology,	all	scientific	work	is	aimed	at	building	a	
coherent	and	convincing	interpretation	of	observational	data.	It	then	has	two	parts:			
		1	-	The	production	of	a	coherent	theoretical	model		
	2	-	The	production	of	agreements	with	observational	data	
		The	mainstream	model	ΛCMD	cannot	be	considered	totally	convincing	insofar	as	:		-	All	
attempts	to	highlight	various	and	varied	models	of	dark	matter	have	so	far	been	
failures	-	There	is	currently	no	theoretical	model	of	dark	energy	that	has	any	
credibility.		It	is	therefore	perfectly	licit	to	present	an	alternative	interpretation	of	the	
phenomena.	
			In	the	article	it	is	proposed	that	these	phenomena	are	attributable	to	the	presence	in	
the	universe	of	negative	mass,	this	existence	being	presented	through	a	coherent	
model	that	frees	itself	from	the	runaway	phenomenon,	in	other	words	that	satisfies	the	
principle	of	action-reaction,	a	model	that	has	already	been	the	subject	of	a	previous	
presentation,	in	your	own	journal	(PRD	Hossenfelder	2008).		
		Since	your	criticism	does	not	refer	to	point	1,	we	assume	that	the	purely	theoretical	
aspects	of	our	article	appeared	acceptable	to	you,	especially	since	they	had	been	
published	in	your	own	journal.			
	You	say	that	there	is	only	one	confirmation	with	observational	data,	concerning	the	
acceleration	of	cosmic	expansion,	and	this	is	shown	in	Figure	2.		This	is	inaccurate.			
		Point	number	1:			
	In	figure	1	of	the	article	it	is	mentioned	the	recently	discovered	phenomenon	(Nature	
2017),	through	a	very	large	scale	mapping	of	the	universe,	to	which	the	name	Great	
Repeller	has	been	given.		To	date,	there	is	no	credible	interpretation	:		If	this	is	
considered	as	a	gap	in	the	hypothetical	positive-mass	dark	matter.	Indeed,	since	

	

5	
gravitational	instability	produces	conglomerates	of	matter	and	not	voids,	one	does	not	
see	what	could	have	given	rise	to	such	a	structure.			The	model	presented	explains	the	
lacunar	structure	of	the	universe	on	a	large	scale,	by	proposing	that	the	negative,	self-
attractive	and	denser	mass	(which	fits	in	passing	with	the	theme	of	cosmic	acceleration,	
under	the	effect	of	the	dominant	pressure	of	negative	mass,	alias	"dark	energy")	first	
forms	a	regular	set	of	conglomerates	which,	pushing	back	the	positive	mass,	confines	it	
in	the	remaining	space	by	giving	it	this	lacunar	structure.		The	model	proposes	that	the	
Great	Repeller	phenomenon	betrays	the	presence	of	one	of	these	conglomerates	of	
negative	mass,	which	cannot	be	detected	optically	since	the	negative	masses	that	
constitute	it	emit	photons	of	negative	energy.		The	existence	of	this	speed	field	evoking	
repulsion	is	the	only	data	we	currently	have,	and	the	model	accounts	for	it,	which	
seems	to	have	escaped	you.				
		Point	number	2:			
	Another	aspect	concerns	the	negative	gravitational	lens	effect,	affecting	the	light	
emitted	by	very	distant	objects,	which	has	already	been	described	in	the	article	you	
published	in	2008.	Such	an	effect	could	have	reduced	the	apparent	magnitude	of	
distant	sources.	This	is	exactly	what	we	observe	with	galaxies	whose	redshift	is	greater	
than	7.		By	the	way	it	is	also	suggested	that	more	precise	observations	in	the	Great	
Repeller	region	could	help	to	determine	the	diameter	of	this	object.		As	already	
presented	and	developed	in	other	papers	by	other	authors,	also	cited	(2017	Farnes,	
Astronomy	and	Astrophysics),	the	flatness	of	the	rotation	curves	of	galaxies	militates	
for	the	fact	that	their	confinement	is	ensured	by	a	negative,	repulsive	mass	
environment.			
			Point	number	3:	
			These	gaps	in	negative	mass,	created	this	time	by	the	presence	of	galaxies	in	their	
centers,	behave	towards	the	gravitational	lens	phenomenon	as	attractive	objects.	The	
model	thus	brings	a	consistent	interpretation	to	the	amplitude	of	the	gravitational	lens	
effects	in	the	vicinity	of	galaxies	and	clusters	of	galaxies,	a	phenomenon	until	now	
considered	as	being	due	to	a	halo	of	dark	matter.				
		Point	number	4	:	
			Masses	of	opposite	signs	are	mutually	exclusive,	thus	the	negative	mass	density	is	
practically	zero	in	the	vicinity	of	the	solar	system	so	that	the	model	is	then	reduced	to	
the	Einstein	equation,	and	agrees	with	the	local	relativistic	observational	data.				
		This	second	rejection	of	our	paper	(which	has	nothing	to	to	with	quantum	field	theory,	
string	theory,	monopoles,	black	holes,	particle	physics,	etc		..)		is	unjustified.		
	We	ask	that	it	be	submitted	to	a	referee,	a	true	expert	both	in	differential	geometry	and	
observational	cosmology	and	astrophysics,	i.e.	a	person	really	able	to	judge	its	
content.			
		We	suggest			:

28 septembre 2020.  Your third rejection :    
Cher Dr. Petit, 
The decision to not send this paper out for review is correct. To elaborate on this 
briefly: 
1. The authors wish to provide an alternative to the dark matter hypothesis in order 
to  explain  one  particular  interesting  cosmic  structure  (the  “Great  Repeller”).  Their 
paper  describes  very  briefly  one  motivation  for  dark  matter  (gravitational  lensing 
measurements), not mentioning any of the others (including, but not limited to, the 
kinematics  of  galaxy  rotation  curves,  the  binding  of  galaxy  clusters,  the  ratio  of 
acoustic  peaks  in  the  cosmic  microwave  background).  In  addition,  they  do  not 
discuss  in  any  detail  whether  the  dark  matter  hypothesis  is  actually  deficient  in 
explaining  this  structure.  An  alternative  hypothesis  needs  to  be  motivated  by  a 
presentation  of  shortcomings  of  the  standard  hypothesis;  this  paper  does  not  do 
this. 
2. The alternative that the authors provide, negative mass, is a rather extraordinary 
one. No evidence is provided that our universe contains bodies of negative mass. A 
well-known  aphorism  has  it  that  “extraordinary  claims  demand  extraordinary 
evidence”; none is provided here. 
3. The writing is very unclear and hard to follow. I grant it appears that the authors 
are  not  native  English  speakers,  so  I  would  be  willing  to  cut  some  leeway  here. 
However, in this case, the presentation is so confusing that I simply cannot parse 
large  sections  of  the  manuscript.  For  example,  the  text  around  the  discussion  of 
Hossenfelder’s work is so confused that I cannot tell if the authors are criticizing that 
work or building off it (or both). 
To summarize, this is a confusing and hard-to-read manuscript that uses a poorly 
motivated  model  to  provide  an  alternative  explanation  to  a  phenomenon,  without 
explaining  why  such  an  alternative  is  necessary  or  desirable.  It  does  not  present 
significant  new  results  in  physics;  it  is  not  of  high  quality,  nor  of  broad  scientific 
interest; and it would not be an important contribution to the literature.

		2020	october	the	8.			Our	third	protest	accompanied	by	a	version	of	the	article	
Dear	Editor,	
	We	have	redrafted	our	article	to	take	into	account	the	arguments	on	the	basis	of	which	
you	refused	to	submit	it	to	a	referee.			In	order	to	respond	to	your	justified	criticism,	we	
had	to	add	26	pages	where	S.	Hossenfelder's	work	is	analyzed	and	where	we	have	
clearly	stated	our	position	with	regard	to	his	work.	In	addition,	we	have	added	other	

extended	from	10	to	45	pages,	to	take	into	account	the	criticisms	you	have	made	:		

	
7	
observational	confirmations	of	our	model,	which	we	had	omitted	in	our	previous	
mailing,	thinking	that	it	would	make	the	article	too	long.	
	Before	rejecting	this	new	drafting	of	our	article	as	being	too	long,	we	recall	that	the	
journal	PRD	has	published	two	articles	([19]	,	[20])	devoted	to	this	bimetric	approach,	
by	Damour,	Kogan	and	Damour,	Kogan	and	Papazoglou,	respectively	42	and	56	pages	
long.		
	A	total	of	98	pages		that	have	not	led	to	any	tangible	results,	nor	to	any	model	likely	to	be	
confronted	with	observations.		
	For	many	years	PRD	has	published	hundreds	of	articles	on		
	
-  String	theory	
-  Cosmic	strings	
-  Mini	black	holes	
-  Hawking	radiative	dissipation	of	black	holes	
-  Firewall	
-  Black	holes	thermodynamics	
-  Monopoles	
- 
Inflatons	
-  Supersymmetry	
-  Massive	gravity	
-  Neutralino	
-  Photino	
-  Gravitino	
-  Tachyon	field	
-  Dark	energy	
-  Quintessence	
-  K-essence	
-  Chaplyguin	gaz	
-  Axions	
-  etc.		
	
None	of	these	articles	led	to	a	confrontation	with	observational	data.		
	About	our	paper	the	Editorial	Board	is	perfectly	right	when	we	writes,	we	quote:		
Following	this	request	we	have	included	in	the	article	all	the	elements	that	bring	credit	
to	this	model.		
	In	point	3	the	Editorial	board	writes:		

2-  The  alternative  that  the  authors  provide,  negative  mass,  is  a  rather 
extraordinary one. No evidence is provided that our universe contains bodies 
of  negative  mass.  A  well-known  aphorism  has  it  that  “extraordinary  claims 
demand extraordinary evidence”; none is provided here. 

3 - The writing is very unclear and hard to follow. I grant it appears that the 
authors  are  not  native  English  speakers,  so  I  would  be  willing  to  cut  some

leeway  here.  However,  in  this  case,  the  presentation  is  so  confusing  that  I 
simply cannot parse large sections of the manuscript. For example, the text 
around the discussion of Hossenfelder’s work is so confused that I cannot tell 
if the authors are criticizing that work or building off it (or both).   

The	Editorial	board	is	right	again.	These	clarifications,	for	an	article	that	is	difficult	to	
read,	were	necessary.	We	have	therefore	devoted	twenty-six	pages	to	:		
-	Produce	a	detailed	analysis	of	S.Hossenfelder's	article	
-	While	emphasizing	the	mathematical	rigor	of	this	approach	pointing	out	the	failures	of	
its	application	to	a	physical	problem.		
-	To	show	how	the	modification	of	the	model	leads	to	results	in	agreement	with	the	
observations.	
At	the	end	of	the	article,	we	have	indicated	the	points	for	which	the	model	will	have	to	
provide	its	own	answers,	which	will	be	provided	in	the	following	article.		
	We	ask	that	this	article	be	submitted	to	a	competent	referee:		
	-	In	differential	geometry	
-	With	respect	to	observational	data	from	cosmology	and	astrophysics	
-	In	topology	
-	In	group	theory	and	especially	dynamic	groups

2020	October	13.		Our	fourth	protest	:			

We have considered your remarks responding to the comments of the Editorial 
Board Member and do not find them to be sufficiently persuasive to warrant any 
further consideration of your manuscript. We therefore regret to inform you that we 
stand by our decision against publication of your paper. 
If you still wish to pursue publication of your manuscript, you will have to submit it 
elsewhere. 
Yours sincerely, 

	________________________________________________________________________________	
	
	Too	good	to	be	true.	
	Dear	Editor	
	We	understand	your	reaction.		
	Magazines	like	yours	receive	hundreds	of	articles	daily	from	all	over	the	world.	Among	
them	are	writings	by	retirees	who	furnish	their	leisure	time,	by	strangers,	who	
sometimes	do	not	even	belong	to	recognized	university	courses,	and	who	present	you	
with	models	that,	by	some	miracle,	claim	to	provide	outsider	solutions	to	problems	that	
the	best	specialists	have	not	been	able	to	provide	answers	to.		
		Before	deciding	to	send	these	articles	to	experts,	who	are	not	paid	to	do	this	work,	
filterers	are	tasked,	who	quickly	evaluate	the	articles	that	flood	in	every	day.	They	then	
ask	themselves	these	questions:		
	-	Who	are	these	people?	Are	they	recognized	by	the	scientific	community	in	this	
specialty?		
	-	Do	they	belong	to	research	groups	from	prestigious	universities?	
	-	Has	the	country	to	which	they	belong	been	distinguished	by	important	work	in	this	
field?	
	-	Does	the	proposed	article	fit	into	the	main	stream?		
	When	the	author(s)	claim(s)	to	supplant	Einstein	by	departing	completely	from	the	
main	stream	(dark	matter,	ΛCDM	model),	to	propose	something	other	than	General	
Relativity,	the	probability	that	the	in-depth	reading	of	an	article	of	several	dozen	pages	
represents	a	waste	of	time	for	the	expert	approached	approaches	unity.		
	In	the	case	of	our	article	there	are	still	some	previous	publications	in	journals	such	as	
Nuovo	Cimento,	Astrophysics	and	Space	Science,	Modern	Physics	Letters	A.	But	perhaps	
the	experts	of	these	journals	did	not	see	the	flaw	in	this	edifice.		
	

	
10	
The	article	itself	seems	logical,	well	constructed.	But	it	all	seems	decidedly	too	good	to	
be	true	:	
	Certainly,	there	are	observational	agreements	that	seem	attractive.	There	is	a	beautiful	
curve	that	goes	well	through	the	points	resulting	from	the	observations.	There	is	a	
beautiful	image	of	a	barred	galaxy,	obtained	by	simulation,	whereas	the	best	specalists	
in	the	world	do	not.	There	is	a	scientific	construction	based	on	a	little-known	
mathematic	field,	dynamic	groups,	which	claims	to	give	an	identity	to	the	invisible	
components	of	the	universe,	solving	the	paradox	of	the	non-observation	of	primordial	
antimatter.		
	So	many	results!		At	a	time	when	theorists	consider	themselves	happy	when	they	
identify	possible	leads.		
	We	agree	with	you.	The	probability	that	the	article	we	sent	you	is	solid	is	a	priori	one	in	
a	thousand.		
	The	difficulty	of	our	approach	was	due	to	one	point:		
	-	If	one	tries	to	be	concise,	it	becomes	incomprehensible.		
	-	If	we	try	to	be	understandable,	then	what	needs	to	be	presented	makes	the	article	
explode,	and	we	are	not	read.		
	Please	make	an	exception.	Submit	it	to	a	referee.	If	this	paper	has	flaws,	or	a	
fundamental	flaw,	that	doesn't	appear	immediately,	he	will	find	it	quickly.

Dear	Dr.	Petit,	
After	you	rebutted	our	decision	not	to	send	out	your	manuscript	for	external	review	we	
consulted	an	Editorial	Board	Member,	which	is	already	a	rare	step	we	take	and	in	that	
sense	the	exception	you	are	asking	for.	The	Editorial	Board	Member	not	only	confirmed	
our	decision	but	also	provided	a	detailed	report	on	why	your	paper	should	not	be	
published	by	Phys.Rev.D.	
Your	response	to	the	report	of	our	Editorial	Board	Member	did	not	change	the	situation	
and	we	decided	against	the	solicitation	of	another	report.	You	are	indeed	correct	in	that	
we	have	to	handle	our	limited	review	resources	with	great	responsability.	
As	we	mentioned	previously,	if	you	still	wish	to	pursue	publication	of	your	manuscript,	
you	will	have	to	submit	it	elsewhere.	
This	concludes	consideration	of	this	manuscript.

I took note that your refusal to submit our article to a referee was definitive and I will 
therefore not insist, despite a new drafting, extending the article to 47 pages, 
including 26 pages devoted to clarifying our position with respect to the work of S. 
Hossenfeder, which we had published in PRD in 2008 and the addition of numerous 
observational confirmations of the model, as well as a determination of the precise 
identity of the invisible components of the universe, that is to say of primordial

2020	october	24.	We	ask	a	simple	question	:	
	
Dear	Dr.	Wimmer	
After	reading	your	final	rejection	message	mentioning	the	detailed	report	on	which	you	
based	your	decision	not	to	have	our	article	reviewed	by	a	referee	we	have	asked	you	for	
a	copy.		
To	our	great	surprise,	this	report	of	September	28	refers	to	the	initial	version	of	the	10-
page	article	that	had	been	sent	to	your	journal.		
	On	October	9	we	had	sent	you	a	version	with	an	additional	35	pages,	representing	the	
responses	to	the	criticisms	you	had	made	in	your	September	28	report.	Twenty-six	
pages	had	been	devoted	to	explain	our	position	with	regard	to	the	work	of	S.	
Hossenfleder,	showing	that	if	its	mathematical	basis	was	correct,	only	a	reinterpretation	
based	on	physics	could	lead	to	confrontations	with	the	observational	data.

Masses	of	the	same	signs	attract	each	other	according	to	Newton's	law	
	
The	masses	of	opposite	signs	repel	each	other	according	to	"anti-Newton"	

		As	you	said	in	that	report	of	September	28th	:	
	
In	this	new	formulation	the	article	:			
	1  We	have	shown	that	the	introduction	of	negative	masses	in	the	cosmological	
model	was	only	possible	by	switching	to	a	bimetric	system	corresponding	to	a	
system	of	two	coupled	field	equations.	This	was	the	only	way	to	escape	the	
runaway	effect	and	to	restore	the	principles	of	equivalence	and	action-
reaction.	As	a	physical	extension	of	a	previous	work	of	S.Hossenfelder,	
mathematically	coherent	(PRD	2008),	we	have	constructed	such	a	system.	
	2  Newtonian	approximation	shows	that	the	interaction	pattern	is	then:		
	
	3  The	negative	masses,	of	negative	energy,	emitting	photons	of	negative	energy,	
which	our	instruments	cannot	capture,	explained	why	some	contents	of	the	
universe	escaped	observation.	
	4  Using	the	theory	of	dynamic	groups	we	have	shown	that	within	this	second	
matter,	of	negative	energy,	the	matter-antimatter	symmetry	was	also	present	
in	this	negative	world.	It	has	been	shown	that	this	one	was	simply	composed	
of	the	same	elements	with	negative	masses	and	negative	energies.		
	5  Taking	up	the	ideas	formulated	in	1967	by	Andrei	Sakharov,	according	to	
which	the	synthesis	of	antimatter	from	antiquarks	would	have	been	faster	
than	the	synthesis	of	matter	from	quarks,	in	this	second	population,	we	
concluded	that	these	invisible	elements	did	not	correspond	to	a	dark	matter	
of	 positive	 mass,	 but	 to	 antimatter	 of	 negative	 mass	:	 antiprotons,	
antineutrons,	anti-electrons,	embedded	in	negative	energy	photons	and	
remaining	negative	energy	quarks,	which	solves	the	paradox	of	the	non-
observation	of	promordial	antimatter	
	6  We	then	constructed	an	exact	solution,	based	on	the	hypothesis	(which	will	
be	justified	in	a	later	article)	of	the	femininity	of	negative	masses.	This	
solution	gives	a	very	good	agreement	with	the	data	from	700	type	Ia	
supernovae.	The	acceleration	of	the	cosmic	expansion	is	thus	explained,	
without	using	the	cosmological	constant	Λ	.		
	7  Since	negative	mass	has	negative	energy,	it	takes	the	place	of	this	unidentified	
dark	energy.	It	is	not	vacuum	energy	and	simply	corresponds	to	a	
contribution	of	quantum	states	of	negative	energy.

8  We	have	shown	that	these	negative	energy	states	emerge	naturally	from	
Dirac's	equation.	An	approach	that	opens	up	major	perspectives	in	Quantum	
Mechanics.		
	9  Considering	that	the	negative	mass	content	is	negligible	in	the	vicinity	of	the	
local	relativistic	
Sun,	the	conclusion	is	that	the	model	agrees	with	
observations:	advance	of	Mercury's	perihelion,	deviation	of	the	light	rays	by	
the	mass	of	the	Sun.		
	10 Still	according	to	the	hypothesis	of	the	dominance	of	the	negative	mass	
content,	we	have	shown	that	the	latter	is	the	first	to	form	a	set	of	spheroidal	
conglomerates	which,	by	pushing	matter	back	into	interstitial	space,	give	it	a	
lacunar	structure.		
	11 This	pattern	of	large-scale	structure	formation	suggests	a	new	pattern	of	
galaxy	formation.	The	positive	mass,	compressed	into	plates	and	thus	heated,	
can	rapidly	dissipate	this	energy	in	the	form	of	radiation	and	thus	present	a	
configuration	favorable	to	the	birth	of	galaxies.		
	12 We	have	suggested	that	the	recently	discovered	Great	Repeller	(2017)	could	
betray	the	presence	of	a	negative	mass	conglomerate.		
	13 Such	objects	would	cause	a	reduction	in	the	magnitude	of	the	objects	in	the	
background.	We	suggest	that	this	is	the	true	reason	for	the	low	magnitude	of	
galaxies	at	z	>7.		
	14 We	say	that	future	progress	in	the	measurement	of	distant	objects	would	
allow,	by	locally	highlighting	a	significant	contrast	in	magnitude,	to	determine	
the	diameter	of	such	a	conglomerate.		
	15 We	speculate	that	these	conglomerates,	composed	of	anti-hydrogen	and	anti-
helium	of	negative	mass,	would	behave	like	immense	protostars	with	a	
cooling	time	greater	than	the	age	of	the	universe.	Thus,	these	objects	would	
not	be	able	to	accommodate	fusion	phenomena	and	therefore	could	not	
produce	stars,	atoms	heavier	than	these	light	elements	and	planets.		
	16 Life	would	be	absent	in	such	negative	world.		
	17 On	a	smaller	scale,	the	negative	gravitational	lens	effect	due	to	a	negative	
mass	environment,	trapping	and	confining	galaxies,	explains	the	importance	
of	the	measured	effects.		
	18 Same	thing	to	explain	the	high	agitation	velocities	of	galaxies	in	clusters,	
exceeding	that	calculated	on	the	lower	visible	mass:	the	confining	negative	
mass	environment	is	again	responsible	for	this	situation.		
	19 This	configuration	also	explains	the	flatness	of	the	rotation	curves	in	galaxies.

20 We	provide	a	model	of	a	spheroidal	galaxy,	built	on	the	basis	of	two	Vlasov	
equations	coupled	by	the	Poisson	equation.	This	elliptical	solution	has	a	radial	
vertex.		
	21 Using	this	model	as	a	support	for	numerical	simulations,	it	was	possible	to	
model	the	birth	of	a	barred	spiral	galaxy,	lasting	for	thirty	turns.		
	22 This	explains	why	the	simulations	carried	out	by	other	authors	had	led	to	the	
fast	dissipation	of	the	spiral	arms,	artificially	introduced	as	a	part	of	initial	
conditions.	These	structures	represent	the	way	in	which	a	dissipative	process	
takes	place	in	these	non-collisional	systems,	reflecting	an	exchange	of	energy	
and	momentum	through	density	waves	present	in	the	two	systems.	If	there	is	
no	second	system	with	which	to	interact,	the	spiral	waves	disappear.		
In	addition	it	was	said	at	the	end	of	the	article	that	the	description	of	the	
radiative	age	and	the	explanation	of	the	establishment	of	this	strong	
asymmetry	would	be	present	in	a	future	article	
Finally,	Mr.	Wimmer,	one	simple	question:
