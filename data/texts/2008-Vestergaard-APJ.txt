ABSTRACT

We present the mass functions of actively accreting supermassive black holes over the redshift range 0.3 ≤ z ≤ 5 for
a well-deﬁned, homogeneous sample of 15,180 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3)
within an effective area of 1644 deg2. This sample is the most uniform statistically signiﬁcant subset available for the
DR3 quasar sample. It was used for the DR3 quasar luminosity function, presented by Richards et al., and is the only
sample suitable for the determination of the SDSS quasar black hole mass function. The sample extends from i p 15
to i p 19.1 at
. The mass functions display a rise and fall in the space density distribution
of active black holes at all epochs. Within the uncertainties the high-mass decline is consistent with a constant slope of
b ≈ (cid:1)3.3
z p
. Our tests suggest that the downturn toward lower mass values is due to incompleteness of the quasar sample with
4
respect to black hole mass. Further details and analysis of these mass functions will be presented in forthcoming papers.

1. INTRODUCTION

We live in exciting times. Since their discovery, the powerhouse
of quasars was believed to be actively accreting supermassiveblack
holes (e.g., Salpeter 1964; Zel’dovich & Novikov 1964). Owing
to recent advances, not only have we been able to conﬁrm the
existence of such dense, powerful objects (e.g., Ghez et al. 2005;
Genzel et al. 2003; Harms et al. 1994); the determination of their
mass has become a common focus of many studies, in spite of
the typically nontrivial nature of this process. The reasoning is
quite simple: (1) for local galaxies, the early studies revealed a
close connection between the black hole mass and the mass, lu-
minosity, and velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component of
the host galaxy (e.g., Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt
2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000a, 2000b), suggesting an intimate con-
nection between their evolutions; and (2) recent semianalytical and
hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., Granato et al. 2004; Springel
et al. 2005; Cattaneo et al. 2006; Kang et al. 2006) show that
black hole evolution and activity may have an important inﬂuence
on the properties of massive elliptical galaxies. Mapping the de-
mography and mass of the black holes in the centers of galaxies
across the history of the universe is a ﬁrst step to understanding
this connection. Since a fraction of the matter accreted onto black
holes as they grow is converted into radiation, the cosmic evolution
of the quasar luminosity function helps constrain the accretion and
growth history of black holes and can therefore also help us un-
derstand the connection with galaxy evolution. Yet certain degen-
eracies limit what we can learn from the luminosity functions (e.g.,
Wyithe & Padmanabhan 2006) owing to the unknown degree of

the radiative efﬁciency and the mass accretion rate and how these
parameters evolve and depend on black hole properties.

In principle, these degeneracies can be broken by combining
the luminosity and mass functions. Recently, Richards et al.
(2006, hereafter R06) presented the luminosity function and its
cosmic evolution from redshift 5 to redshift 0.3 for a well-de-
ﬁned, homogeneous subset of 15,180 quasars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 3 (DR3) quasar catalog
of over 46,400 quasars for which the quasar selection function
is well-determined. Therefore, the determination of the mass
function for this speciﬁc quasar sample is of high interest. In
this Letter we present this mass function of actively accreting
black holes and its cosmic evolution from redshift 5 to 0.3.

To determine the mass of the black holes we adopt the scaling
relations based on the broad emission line widths and nuclear con-
tinuum luminosities (e.g., Vestergaard 2002; Warner et al. 2003;
Vestergaard & Peterson 2006) because (1) they are anchored in
robust black hole mass determinations of active black holes in the
nearby universe (Peterson et al. 2004; Onken et al. 2004), (2) several
lines of evidence exist in favor of our application of this method to
the most distant active black holes (see Vestergaard 2008 for details),
and (3) the associated uncertainties on the mass estimates are among
the lowest for the available mass estimation methods for distant
sources. A cosmology of H0 p 70 km s(cid:1)1 Mpc(cid:1)1, p 0.7, and
Qm

p 0.3 is used throughout.

2. SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS

As noted above, we use the quasar sample presented by R06
because it is well-deﬁned and has a well-understood selection
function; this is not the case for the full DR3 or the DR5 sample.
Therefore it is currently also the only sample suitable for the
determination of the black hole mass function. The reader is
referred to R06 for details on the sample and its selection.

In order to estimate the mass of the central black hole in each
quasar we need to measure the widths of each of the Hb, Mg ii,
and the C iv emission lines and the monochromatic nuclear con-
tinuum luminosity near these emission lines. Since quasar spectra

contain contributions from other emission components which often
“contaminate” the line and continuum components of interest, we
model each of these emission contributions so as to obtain reliable
measurements after decomposition of the modeled components. In
the following we provide only a very brief summary of our data
handling. A more detailed account of our processing of the SDSS
spectra will be presented by M. Vestergaard et al., (in preparation).
Each spectrum is corrected for Galactic reddening based on
E(B (cid:1) V )
the
value relevant for the quasar (Schneider et al.
2005) and the Galactic extinction maps by Schlegel et al.
(1998). The continuum components were modeled using (1) a
nuclear power-law continuum, (2) an optical–UV iron line
spectrum (Ve´ron-Cetty et al. 2004; Vestergaard & Wilkes
2001), (3) a Balmer continuum, and (4) a host galaxy spectrum
(for objects at
for which the galaxy contribution is
strongest and is best characterized; Bruzual & Charlot 2003).
The continuum components were subtracted and the emis-
sion lines were then modeled with multiple Gaussian functions
so as to obtain smooth representations of the data. This allows
us to eliminate most narrow absorption lines, noise spikes, and
the contribution from the narrow emission line region, which
is by far the strongest in the optical region. A single Gaussian
component, not to exceed a FWHM of 600 km s
, was used
to model and subtract the narrow-line components. The line
widths of Hb, Mg ii, and C iv were measured for all emission
lines with model line peaks above 3 times the median ﬂux
density error across the emission line (i.e., ≥3 j peaks).
All Mg ii and C iv proﬁles with strong absorption were
discarded from further analysis. They were identiﬁed by visual
inspection of the spectra of the quasars listed in the catalog of
Trump et al. (2006) to have absorption and of the quasars with
redshifts between 1.4, when C iv enters the observing window,
and 1.7. These quasars are prone to have strong C iv absorption
but this redshift range is not covered by Trump et al. (2006).
Of the 15,180 quasars on which the DR3 quasar luminosity
function (R06) is based, black hole mass estimates were pos-
sible for 14,434 (95%).

3. BLACK HOLE MASS ESTIMATES

The speciﬁc mass scaling relations we use are equations (5) and
(7) of Vestergaard & Peterson (2006) based on the FWHM of Hb
and C iv and a new relationship for the Mg ii emission line based
on high-quality data from the SDSS DR3 quasar sample (M. Ves-
tergaard et al., in preparation). For each quasar a black hole mass
estimate is computed for each of the Hb, Mg ii, and C iv emission
lines rendered suitable for mass estimates (§ 2). The ﬁnal black hole
mass was computed as the variance-weighted average of the indi-
vidual mass estimates. The mass estimates based on the individual
emission lines match well within their errors.

z ≥ 3

Figure 1 shows the redshift distribution of the black hole masses.
Its detailed shape is mainly a consequence of the survey properties
and limitations: (1) the scarcity of quasars at 2.2 ≤ z ≤ 3.0 is due
to inefﬁcient quasar selection, discussed later, and (2) the lower
boundary is determined mainly by the faint survey ﬂux limits (i
! 19.1 mag at z ! 3.0; i ! 20.2 mag at
). While the bright
ﬂux limit (i 1 15 mag) of the SDSS is expected to eliminate the
most massive black holes at z ! 1, this does not have a strong
impact on the current study. Judging from the comparison made
(Jester et al. 2005) between the Bright Quasar Survey (BQS;
Schmidt & Green 1983) and the SDSS, the surface density of
quasars brighter than i p 15.0 is such that at least six such bright
quasars are expected in the 1622 deg2 of the current sample; this
is a lower limit since the BQS itself is incomplete. If these bright
quasars follow the same redshift distribution as the BQS quasars

at
, mass estimates were possible for 14,584. Of these, 14,434 quasars have
redshifts between 0.3 and 5.0. The median mass in each redshift bin shown in Fig.
2 is marked with a square. The median propagated black hole mass measurement
error is shown in the lower part of the diagram. For reference, the dashed curve

detected by the SDSS, they will mostly lie at z (cid:1) 0.25, below the
minimum redshift bound (0.3) of the mass functions. Also, no
upper limit in line width is imposed that would place an upper
bound on the black hole masses. While we do deselect low-quality
emission-line proﬁles (see § 2), this process applies to all proﬁle
widths (and thus all black hole masses). Given our large sample
size (nearly 15,000 quasars) and that we know of no selection
effects that would systematically deselect the most massive black
holes, it is fair to conclude that the upper bound in black hole
mass is real. The mass distribution in Figure 1 therefore conﬁrms
with larger numbers the results from previous studies (e.g., Warner
et al. 2003; Netzer 2003; Corbett et al. 2003; Vestergaard 2004;
McLure & Dunlop 2004; Kollmeier et al. 2006; Netzer & Trakh-
tenbrot 2007; see also Vestergaard 2006, 2008; Shen et al. 2007)
that ﬁnd the detected quasars at high redshift have black hole
masses between a few # 108 and 1010
, with typical mass of
order 109

MBH

The differential quasar black hole mass function, W(

, z), is
the space density of quasar black holes (i.e., the number of black
holes per unit comoving volume) per unit black hole mass as a
function of black hole mass and redshift. We calculate this space
density in different mass and redshift bins using the 1/ method
following Warren et al. (1994), where
is the accessible volume,
deﬁned by Avni & Bahcall (1980). We adopt the method of Fan
et al. (2001) of including the selection function of the quasars: we
interpolate the selection function between the grid points deﬁned
by the quasar luminosity and redshift and integrate over the selection
function in determining
(see eq. [6] of Fan et al). The SDSS
DR3 quasar selection function for our quasar sample is published
by R06. The mass function (and its statistical uncertainty) is given

uncertainty). The mean redshift of each redshift bin is labeled. The boundaries of the redshift bins are 0.3, 0.68, 1.06, 1.44, 1.82, 2.2, 2.6, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0.
In each panel the z p 0.49 and 2.01 mass functions are also shown as dotted and dashed curves for reference. The vertical dashed and dotted lines mark the masses

may also affect bins of higher mass values. See text for details and discussion. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this ﬁgure.]

In Figure 2 we show the mass functions at a range of redshifts.

data points with large errors are typically due to very few
quasars residing in those mass bins.

5. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

For each redshift bin in Figure 2 the mass function displays a
rise and fall in the mass distribution. The decline toward higher
masses is expected to be intrinsic to the quasar population (§ 3);
while the uncertainty in the mass estimates will affect the accuracy
of the slope value, it is too small to be responsible for the decline.
We determine6 a typical high-end slope b of about (cid:1)3.3 (W ∝
) with uncertainties between 0.4 and 1.3 for the mass functions

below a redshift of 4. At the mean redshifts of 4.25 and 4.75 the
b ≈ (cid:1)1.9 (cid:2)
high-end slope “ﬂattens” to
, respectively. The mass function at redshift 4.75 is based on
1.7
very few black holes at each mass bin, especially for M ≥
1010 M,
, so the shape is somewhat uncertain. The mass functions
are clearly consistent with a constant slope across all epochs. This

is determined for masses above
9.2 dex and at

(essentially) completely populated. To account somewhat for the uncertainties
in the
values and the fact that the mass bin population varies, the un-
certainty in a given mass bin was estimated as the propagated uncertainty in
the absolute mass estimates (e.g., Table 5 of Vestergaard & Peterson 2006)

is also easily veriﬁed in Figure 2 by the reference curves for the
mass functions at z p 0.49 (dotted curve) and at z p 2.01 (dashed
curve), which also show that the space density of high-mass black
holes slightly increases at

z (cid:2) 1

.

b ≈ (cid:1)3.3

The slope of the mass functions is consistent with the bright-
end slope of the quasar luminosity function (
; Croom
et al. 2004; R06) to within the uncertainties with the exception
b p (cid:1)2.5
that the latter ﬂattens above a redshift of 4 (to
;
Schmidt et al. 1995; Fan et al. 2001). Another difference is
the relative normalizations. The mass functions exhibit a
change in space density for a given mass of only a factor of
a few between z p 0.5 and z p 2 (cf. the dotted and dashed
curves in Fig. 2), while the space density of quasars brighter
than about (cid:1)27 mag drops 2 orders of magnitude or more
between redshifts 2 and 0.5 (Fig. 18 of R06). While there is
no one-to-one correspondence between a given mass value and
a given luminosity value since black holes radiate at a range
of (Eddington) rates, the different space density changes show
that the cumulative volume density of
) decreases
toward low redshift. This conﬁrms what we already know based
on the declining space density of active nuclei at later epochs
(e.g., R06): low-redshift black holes are typically less active.
In Figure 2 a characteristic peak shift to higher mass values with
redshift is seen. It is important to establish the reality of these peaks
and their shifts, given the cosmological implications. For one, it
would be a clear manifestation of cosmic downsizing: the most
massive black holes were more actively accreting early in the uni-
verse and with time progressively less massive black holes dominate
the population of actively accreting black holes. Alternatively, the
downturn toward lower mass values may simply be due to incom-

pleteness of the sample, as the source selection is based on the
source luminosity and broadband colors, not on black hole mass.
As a result, we will not obtain a sharp lower boundary in mass (as
we do in the luminosity distribution) but a decrease in space density
below the survey ﬂux limits, owing to the distribution of black hole
masses at a given luminosity. Unfortunately, the SDSS does not go
deep enough for us to make meaningful cuts in black hole mass
for the current sample, as will be clear later.

(dashed vertical line) and 3500 km s

The best way to assess which part of the downturn is intrinsic
requires detailed simulations that include the uncertainties in the
mass estimates, the selection function, and the ﬂux limits. Since this
is nontrivial we will address this in a forthcoming paper (B. Kelly
et al., in preparation). Here, we instead perform crude checks as
follows. First, in Figure 2 we mark the masses of a ﬁducial source
at the mean bin redshift with a continuum luminosity equivalent to
the ﬂux limit at that redshift and a broad line width of 2000 km
(cid:1)1
s
(dotted vertical line),
is the canonical lower line width for
respectively; 2000 km s
which a source is a bona ﬁde quasar and 3500 km s
is the median
line width for nearby quasars. There are objects below the dashed
line since the observed i-band magnitude contains emission con-
tribution in addition to the power-law continuum luminosity used
for the mass estimates. Nonetheless, these ﬁducial masses do yield
a guideline location of the SDSS ﬂux limits in the mass parameter
space, and their location close to the peak of the mass distribution
suggests that the peak shift is simply due to the survey ﬂux limits.
Given the nontrivial relationship between the i-band magnitude
and the monochromatic luminosity, we also performed a simple
simulation with the aim of minimizing selection effects. We gen-
erated a mock catalog of quasars covering redshifts between 0.2
and 5.0 and bolometric luminosities between
erg
(cid:1)1
s . For each (
) grid point we computed the distribution of
black hole masses by applying the typical observed line width
distribution for these L and z values. The mass functions based
on this mock catalog (not shown) do not display the narrowly
peaked distributions seen in Figure 2, but display a slower con-
tinued rise in the distribution below the high-mass fast decline and
a sharp downturn at the lowest masses which coincides with the
lower luminosity bound. No downturn is seen at the low-mass
end if a sharp cut in black hole mass is imposed. Hence, this mock
catalog conﬁrms the earlier indication that the low-mass downturn
in the observed mass functions is a consequence of the relatively
narrow luminosity range probed by SDSS broadened by the line

width distribution, especially at higher redshift. We thus conclude
that the peaks and their shifts with redshift are mainly due to
incompleteness of active black holes near the survey ﬂux limits.
These crude checks are, however, unable to verify which part of
the turnover is trustworthy. The mass functions in the lower red-
shift bins display a slower turnover, part of which may well be
real. B. Kelly et al. (in preparation) will present more advanced
simulations that address these and related issues.
The space density decline at z ≈ 2.8 relative to z p 2.4 and z
p 3.25 in Figure 2 is caused by a much lower selection efﬁciency
(by a factor of 8; Fig. 6 of R06) as quasars at these epochs coincide
with the stellar loci in the selected color spaces. This suggests that
the completeness level is slightly overestimated at these epochs.
This situation is unfortunate since the space density of quasars is
known to peak between redshifts of 2 and 3 (e.g., Osmer 1982;
Warren et al. 1994; Schmidt et al. 1995; Fan et al. 2001). It is
thus not possible with the current sample to get a complete picture
of how the space density distribution of black holes behaves during
this important epoch. The Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS;
Hewett et al. 1995) of about 1000 quasars, extending to a redshift
of 3, offers an opportunity to address these issues further, since
this sample is not selected based on broadband color. The LBQS
quasar mass function will be presented by M. Vestergaard & P.
S. Osmer (in preparation) and discussed in concert with the DR3
mass function by M. Vestergaard et al. (in preparation), where the
mass functions will also be compared to previous work.
