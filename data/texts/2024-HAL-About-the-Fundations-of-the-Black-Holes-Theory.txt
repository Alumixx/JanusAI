Abstract	:		In	a	broad	overview,	we	discuss	the	two	interpretations	that	have	been	given	
of	the	outer	Schwarzschild	solution,	depending	on	whether	one	opts	for	uniqueness,	in	
which	case	the	geometric	object	has	a	single	layer,	a	structure	of	a	variety	with	an	edge,	
or	non-uniqueness	of	the	solution,	i.e.	for	a	configuration	in	which	there	are	two	metrics,	
each	referring	to	one	of	the	layers	of	a	covering	structure	with	two	sheets,	joined	by	a	
groove	sphere.	In	these	two	interpretations,	the	object	is	non-contractile.	The	black	hole	
model,	as	described	in	Chandrasekhar's	1992	book	entitled	"Mathematics	of	Black	Holes",	
is	based	on	the	central	hypothesis	of	including	in	the	real	world	particles	whose	geodesic	
trajectories	are	traversed	with	pure	imaginary	proper	time,	which	goes	hand	in	hand	with	
the	hypothesis	of	contractibility	of	the	geometric	object,	which	is	then	equipped	with	a	
central	singularity.

1	-	Introduction	
In	2011,	C.	Corda	published	an	article	[1]	entitled	"A	clarification	on	the	debate	on	the	
'original	Schwarzschid	solution'"	in	the	form	of	a	simple	preprint	posted	online	on	the	
arXiv	platform,	to	which	specialists	refer	anyone	wishing	to	question	the	physical	and	
mathematical	consistency	of	the	black	hole	model.	We	propose	to	return	to	this	question.		
Recent	observations	([2],[3])	of	supermassive	objects	located	at	the	centre	of	the	M87	and	
Milky	Way	galaxies,	which	were	immediately	described	as	"Giant	Black	Holes",	are	far	
from	being	consistent	with	what	characterises	black	holes	in	principle,	i.e.	that	their	
central	part	is	absolutely	black.	Even	if	no	value	is	placed	on	the	temperature	values	
displayed,	the	ratio	of	maximum	temperature	to	minimum	temperature	constitutes	
usable	observational	data.

Although	the	masses	and	temperatures	of	these	two	objects	are	very	dissimilar,	the	ratios	
of	maximum	temperature	to	minimum	temperature	are	surprisingly	close	to	3.	This	
closeness	can	hardly	be	attributed	to	chance	and,	at	the	end	of	the	article,	we	will	examine	
the	possible	significance	of	this	value.	Let's	take	a	look	back	at	what	is	known	as	the	
"Original	Schwarzschild	Solution".	
	2	–	The		original	Schwarzschild	solution.		
It	corresponds	to	the	two	articles	published	by	the	author	in	January	1916	[4]	and	
February	1916	[5],	shortly	before	his	death	on	11	May	1916.	The	English	translations	
were	not	available	until	very	late,	the	first	article	in	1975	[6]	and	the	second	in	1999	[7],	
twenty-four	and	eighty-three	years	after	their	publication	in	German.		The	approach	is	
very	clear.	The	author	starts	with	the	field	equation	as	Einstein	had	just	published	it	two	
months	earlier	[8].	In	what	follows,	our	equations	are	sometimes	numbered	twice.	In	this	
case,	as	below,	on	the	left	will	appear	the	numbering	of	the	article	and	on	the	right,	in	
italics,	the	numbering	in	the	article	from	which	this	equation	is	extracted.	to	cause.	Thus,	
in	[5]	it	is	equation	(5)	:		
		
(1)																																																																
where	
	is	the	Einstein	constant	and	T	is	the	Laue	scalar.	Schwarzschild	clearly	indicates	
his	course	of	action,	specifying	that	the	calculation	of	geodesics	will	be	based	on	the	
optimisation	of	the	length	s.	These	are	equations	(1)	from	[4],	which	we	reproduce	exactly	
as	they	appear	below:

At	the	same	time,	the	author	constructs	stationary	solutions	of	the	field	equation,	with	
and	without	a	second	member.	In	this	approach,	which	is	remarkable	for	its	clarity	and	
physical,	geometric	and	mathematical	coherence,	he	endeavours	to	ensure	the	continuity	
of	the	solution	at	the	surface	of	the	star.	On	page	2	of	[5]	he	writes,	and	we	quote:	
	
This	means	that	its	variable	r,	which	is	perfectly	defined,	can	only	be	positive	or	zero.	
Let's	start	by	analysing	the	calculation	that	gives	his	interior	metric,	which	describes	the	
.	As	in	
geometry	inside	a	sphere	filled	with	incompressible	matter	of	constant	density	
all	his	calculations	he	used	c	=	1,	we	will	reconstruct	the	equations	by	reintroducing	this	
letter	where	it	belongs.	The	schemes	for	the	two	calculations	are	similar,	in	terms	of	the	
choice	of	coordinates	and	the	calculation	of	the	components	of	the	tensor	of	the	first	
member,	which	is	common	to	both	solutions.	The	interior	metric	is	given	in	equation	(35)	
of	[5]:

is	assumed	to	be	constant,	he	relies	on	a	geometry

This	would	enable	him	to	write	his	external	metric:

n	example	of	this	would	be	the	"Original	Schwarzschild	Solution".	What	are	its	
properties?		Its	determinant	is:

This	tends	towards	zero	with	r.		Let's	isolate	its	spatial	part:

apart	from	the	nullity	of	its	determinant	at	r	=	0,	this	metric	is	by	no	means	singular.	
Schwarzschild	was	then	faced	with	the	problem	of	identifying	its	two	solutions	(14)	and

Schwarzschild	thus	discovered	a	simple	way	of	identifying	the	two	metrics	at	the	surface	
of	the	star.	All	he	had	to	do	in	the	external	metric	was	to	change	the	variable:		
(26)																																																																	
oducing	what	he	calls	an	"intermediate	quantity"	(Hilfsgröbe)	which	automatically	
implies	that	and	this	metric	then	becomes:		
	
(27)																																				
We	have	therefore	simply	discovered	an	initial	reason	why	Schwarzschild	chose	to	
present	the	external	metric	in	this	form.	At	this	stage	he	is	trying	to	find	Einstein's	result	
concerning	the	advance	of	Mercury's	perihelion	[9].	By	carrying	out	the	limited	expansion,	
which	is	explicitly	mentioned	in	his	article	on	page	7			
(28)																																																						
But	it	never	occurred	to	him	to	think	that	this	external	metric,	considered	in	isolation,	
could	refer	to	a	physical	object..		
	3	–	The	construction	of		Ludwig	Flamm'	meridian	[10]		.		
In	the	months	that	followed,	the	young	mathematician	Ludwig	Flamm,	who	was	31	at	the	
time	Schwarzschild's	article	appeared,	became	interested	in	this	solution,	in	the	form	of	
pairs	of	connected	metrics.	He	also	applied	it	[10]	to	evaluate	the	deviation	of	light	rays	
grazing	the	surface	of	the	Sun	and	obtained	the	value	1.75'',	in	good	agreement	with	
Einstein's	result.		What	is	interesting	is	the	precise	analysis	he	gives	from	the	geometric	
angle.	This	article	remains	little	known	because	it	was	only	available	in	an	English	
translation	when	it	was	republished	in	this	form	in	2015	[11].	This	geometry	of	Einstein's	
equation,	invariant	by	time	translation,	is	equivalent	to	the	displacement	along	this	time	
coordinate	of	a	3-surface,	whose	metric	is	given	by	the	spatial	parts	of	the	two	solutions.

At	this	stage,	neither	Schwarzschild	nor	Flamm	envisaged	treating	the	Schwarzschild	
exterior	metric,	considered	in	isolation,	as	a	physical	object.	
	4	–	Attempts	to	model	a	mass	by	H.Weyl,	Einstein	and	Rosen.			
When	Schwarzschild's	article	was	published,	Weyl	was	the	same	age	as	Flamm.	He	then	
envisaged	using	the	external	metric	to	describe	a	mass	as	the	source	of	a	gravitational	
field.	At	a	distance,	geodesics	of	non-zero	length	can	be	likened	to	the	trajectories	of	
planets,	when	they	are	quasi-elliptical,	or	for	certain	non-periodic	comets,	quasi-
hyperbolic	or	quasi-parabolic.	The	further	away	we	are	from	the	source	of	this	field,	the	
more	they	tend	towards	Keplerian	conics.	On	the	other	hand,	if	we	move	closer,	we	have	
to	discover	what	strange	geometric	structure	is	responsible	for	creating	the	gravitational	
field	that	we	can	then,	at	a	distance,	believe	to	have	been	created	by	a	point	mass.		To	this	
end,	Weyl	had	to	give	the	Schwarzschild	solution,	considered	in	isolation,	the	character	of	
a	physical	object.	He	uses	the	equation	published	by	Einstein	in	November	2015	[8],	which	
shows	the	Laue	scalar	T,	instead	of	the	Ricci	scalar	R	in	the	standard	form	that	is	now	
traditionally	used.:		
(35)																																																																		
He	also	constructed	geodesic	trajectories	of	zero	length	(ds	=	0)	corresponding	to	the	
paths	of	light	rays.	For	the	material	particles	affected	by	the	field,	he	unambiguously	
states:		
(36)																																																																				
Geodesics,	which	can	be	deduced	from	the	variation:	
(37)																																																																							
Then	considering	the	case	of	solutions	invariant	by	time	translation,	he,	like	all	his	
by	writing	the	metric	in	the	
contemporaries,	materialised	a	type	signature	
form:		
		
(38)																																							
Like	Flamm,	he	isolates	the	temporal	part	from	the	spatial	part.	And,	like	Flamm,	he	
constructs	the	equation	of	the	meridian	in	the	form	of	a	recumbent	parabola:		
(39)																																																																		
He	designates	the	Schwarzschild	radius	by	the	quantity	2a.	He	therefore	has	three	
	of	r	to	determine:	.	Like	Hilbert	[13]	and	Droste	[14]	he	
unknown	functions	
chooses	to	reduce	his	calculation	to	just	two	unknown	functions	by	posing	,	which	will	
have	the	advantage	of	immediately	evoking	the	identification	with	the	Lorentz	metric	at	
infinity,	and	arrives	at	the	result	:

	5	–	Describing	an	unsteady	phenomenon	using	a	stationary	metric.			
The	most	general	form	of	a	time-independent	SO(3)-invariant	solution	is	([1],	[17]):		
		
(46)																													
Such	a	solution	is	not	invariant	to	changing	t	to	-	t.	So,	for	the	same	coordinate	
	
point,	we	might	expect	to	have	not	one	solution,	but	two.	Now,	in	physics,	when	theorists	
are	looking	for	a	solution	to	a	differential	equation,	or	to	a	system	of	differential	equations,	
they	first	give	themselves	boundary	conditions,	and	then	try	to	construct	a	solution	that	
is	unique.	In	the	case	of	the	search	for	a	stationary	solution	to	the	Einstein	equation,	these	
boundary	conditions	consist	of	imposing	that	the	solution	be	Lorentzian	at	infinity.	If	we	
focus	on	the	requirement	of	uniqueness,	we	obtain	G.D.Birkhoff's	theorem	[18].	This	then	
rules	out	the	presence	of	a	cross	term	in	dr	dt.	Such	a	solution	is	then	invariant	by	time	
inversion,	which	is	not	based	on	any	physical	constraint.	It	is	then	qualified	as	static,	as	
opposed	to	stationary,	which	expresses	invariance	by	temporal	translation.	But,	for	
example	in	[10],	[12],	[15],	[16],	there	are	interpretations	of	the	stationary	solution	with	
spherical	symmetry	that	reveal	a	different	topology,	with	two	sheets	connected	by	a	
throat	sphere,	described	as	a	bridge	by	Einstein	and	Rosen.	So	the	non-uniqueness	of	the	
solution	is	not	simply	permitted,	but	necessary,	in	order	to	differentiate	between	what	
refers	to	one	of	the	slicks	and	what	refers	to	the	other.	We	can	therefore	see	that	Birkhoff's	
theorem	implies	an	additional,	implicit	hypothesis	of	a	topological	nature.	If	we	consider	
the	two-folds	structure,	which	is	also	non-contractile,	then	the	presence	of	the	cross	term

"standard	interpretation"	of	the	Schwarzschild	outer	solution,	as	the	basis	of	the	black

Eq.	(32)	looks	formally	equal	to	the	“standard	Schwarzschild	solution”

see	in	the	following	that	this	interpretation	is	not	correct.		
On	 the	 other	 hand,	 we	 are	 searching	 solution	 for	 the	 external	

geometry	,thus	we	assumed	r	≥	0		in	Eq.(3)	and	from	Eq.	(31)	it	il	always

to	the	mathematical	singularity	at		X	=	0	.	This	singularity	is	not	physical

Again,	 we	 emphasize	 the	 apparent	 different	 assumption	 of	 our	
analysis.	As	it	is	carefully	explained	in	[42],	the	“standard	Schwarzschild	
solution”	(1),	arises	from	the	hypothesis	that	the	coordinates	r	and	t	of	
the	two	functions	(4)	are	chosen	in	order	to	guarantee	that	the	length	of	
the	circumference	centred	in	the	origin	of	the	coordinate	system	is	2πr.	
Indeed,	in	the	above	derivation	of	“the	original	Schwarzschild	solution”	

(30),	 r	 and	 t	 are	 chosen	 in	 order	 to	 guarantee	 that	 the	 length	 of	 the	
circumference	centred	in	the	origin	of	the	coordinate	system	is	not	2πr.	

In	 particular,	 choosing	 to	 put	 the	 mathematical	 singularity	 of	 the	

17	

	

3)1/3

function	A	at	X	=	0	is	equivalent	to	the	physical	condition	that	the	length	
of	 the	 circumference	 centred	 in	 the	 origin	 of	 the	 coordinate	 system	 is	
.	Then,	one	could	think	that	by	forcing	the	transformation	
(31)	for	r	≤	0,	one	returns	to	the	standard	Schwarzschild	solution	(1),	but	
become	Euclidean.	In	that	case,	such	a	mathematical	forcing	could	be	the	

a	 bi-dimensional	 spherical	 surface,	 that

cause	of	the	singularity	in	the	core	of	the	black-hole.	Thus,	this	singularity	
could	be	only	mathematical	and	not	physical.	But	in	the	following,	by	
matching	with	the	internal	geometry,	we	will	see	that	this	interpretation	
is	not	correct	and	that	the	singularity	in	the	core	of	the	BH	remains	a	
physical	 singularity	 also	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 “original	 Schwarzschild	
solution”	given	by	Eq.	(30).	

rg ≪ r
  

Notice	 that	 a	 large	 distances,	 i.e.	 where	

	r,	 the	 solution	 (30)	
well	approximates	the	standard	Schwarzschild	solution	(1),	thus,	both	of	
the	weak	field	approximation	and	the	analysis	of	astrophysical	situations	
remain	the	same.	

	We	have	underlined	in	red	the	geometric	object	described	by	C.	Corda	as	a	'non-
dimensional	material	point'.	We	have	not	been	able	to	find	a	definition	of	such	an	
object	in	mathematics	or	geometry,	and	it	seems	to	exist	only	in	the	imagination	of	
its	author.	
	He	then	describes	the	portion	of	space	corresponding	to	the	value	
	of	the	
coordinate	singularity,	i.e.	in	the	system	
	,	which	is	correct,	but	he	errs

The	first	person	to	modify	this	expression	was	David	Hilbert,	on	23	December	
1916	[23].	In	Schwarzschild's	presentation,	three	functions	of	r	:	F	,	G	,	H	are	to	be

Then	 we	 are	 equally	 justified	 in	 interpreting

polar	coordinates.	If	we	introduce		
eliminate	the	sign	
,	the	result	is	the	expression		
	
(74)										
	Don't	look	to	Hilbert	for	high-geometry	justifications.	He	simply	sees	this	as	a	
way	of	having	to	determine	only	two	functions,	instead	of	three.		
	
Corda	cites	Droste's	construction	of	the	solution	in	1917[14]	as	leading	to	"the	
standard	form	of	Schwarzshild's	solution".		Droste	presents	his	solution	in	the	form:

	Droste,	too,	realised	that	the	construction	of	the	solution	could	be	reduced	to	
that	of	two	unknown	functions,	in	this	case	 w	and	 v	.	He	made	two	successive

He	then	faced	the	problem	of	boundary	conditions:	How	to	choose	a	new	space	
variable	such	that,	as	it	tends	towards	infinity,	the	metric	tends	towards	the	Lorentz	
metric.	The	solution	was	quickly	found		:		
	(78)																																																												
	The	result	is	what	Corda	calls	"the	standard	form	of	the	Schwarzchild	solution".:	
	(79)																									
	
n	fact,	the	only	constraint	is	that	when	the	value	of	a	spatial	coordinate	tends	
towards	infinity,	the	metric	has	a	Lorentzian	form.	Otherwise,	all	coordinate	forms	
are	possible	and	refer	only	to	different	representation	systems.	In	fact,	these	choices	
are	simply	different	ways	of	representing	the	same	object,	where	the	only	intrinsic	
quantity	that	is	invariant	to	changes	in	coordinates	is	the	length	s.	The	scientist	is	
therefore	like	a	blind	man	who	has	only	one	measure	of	length,	using	his	hands,	to	
assess	the	shape	of	an	object..		
	Flamm	[10]	immediately	understood	that	we	could	concentrate	on	the	spatial	
part	of	a	time	translation	invariant	solution.		This	can	be	taken	into	account	in	the	
physical	solution	presented	by	Schwarzschild	in	the	form	of	two	regular,	connecting	
metrics,	without	any	singular	aspect	appearing	in	space.	This	3D	geometric	object,	
which	we	might	call	the	Schwarzschild-Flamm	hypersurface,	is	then	contractible.	It	
turns	out	that	it	can	be	plunged	into	.	And	plane	cuts	can	be	made	in	such	an	object,	
for	example	at	constant.	The	plane	section	of	a	3D	object	is	a	2D	object.	Here	is	this	
section,	taken	from	[24]..

There	is	no	one	representation	space	that	is	better	than	another.	It's	all	a	question	
of	knowing	what	game	you	want	to	play.	If	this	approach	consists	of	imposing	that	
,	then	the	solution	to	the	equation	delivers	the	same	message,	in	different	
forms	depending	on	the	geometric	context	chosen.	If	we	impose	the	uniqueness	of	
the	solution,	then	there	will	only	be	one	layer	and	one	metric.	
	With	 the	 space-time	 associated	 with	 the	 coordinates	
or	
the	3D	hypersurface	will	have	an	edge	with	the	topology	of	a	sphere	
S2.	In	the	second	case,	the	sphere	will	be	made	up	of	points	with	coordinates	and	
the	area	of	this	sphere	will	be	.	In	the	first	case,	the	edge	sphere	will	have	the	same	
.	This	situation	will	come	as	no	
area,	but	its	points	will	correspond	to	
shock	to	a	geometric	mathematician.	Similarly,	who	can	create	a	mental	
representation	of	Minkowski	space,	where	the	square	of	the	hypothenuse	is	equal	
to	the	difference	between	two	adjacent	sides?	Who	has	a	mental	diagram	in	which	
the	phenomena	of	quantum	mechanics	become	clear?		
	If	we	consider	the	possibility	of	non-uniqueness,	of	a	bimetric	solution,	
the	edge	sphere	becomes	a	throat	sphere.		
	
This	being	the	case,	when	C.Corda	says	:	
	
this	sentence	reveals	his	lack	of	mastery	of	the	subject,	because,	given	the	very	
definition	of	these	coordinates		:

decades,	when	black	hole	specialists	have	been	talking	about	the	foundations	of	the	
model,	they	have	always	referred	to	earlier	work	that	would	have	enabled	them	to	
analyse	them	definitively.	We	were	present	in	2017	at	the	"Schwarzschild	Annual	
Colloquium"	held	in	his	home	town.	Juan	Maldacena,	a	pioneer	in	black	hole	physics,	
was	the	guest	speaker.	He	began	his	talk	by	saying:	
- 
	
Corda	is	no	exception	to	this	rule,	writing:	

	,	θ	=	0,	ϕ	=	0	in	the	original	r,	θ,	ϕ	coordinates.

will	tend	to	collapse	in	on	itself.	If	it	is	a	neutron	star,	criticality	may	be	due	to	an

7	–	The	foundations	of	black	holes	theory.		
	Before	the	Second	World	War,	all	publications	in	mathematics	or	theoretical	
physics	journals	were	based	on	the	following	points.	
	The	metric	was	written	as	([4],[9],[6],[10],[12],[14])	:		
	(80)																																																							
		
Geodesics	were	defined	as	curves	minimising	a	length	s	.	As	C.Corda	refers	to	Droste's	
paper	as	the	first	construction	of	the	"standard	Schwarzschild	solution",	we	will	quote	the	
Lagrangian	expression	given	by	Droste	[14]	in	his	equation	(9):		
(81)																																							
		
At	that	time,	the	concept	of	a	signature	was	not	yet	used,	but	it	was	in	fact	everywhere	in	
the	form	
.	In	his	presentation,	C.	Corda	discusses	the	history	of	this	stationary	
solution	to	Einstein's	spherically	symmetric	equation.	He	writes	
-	A	few	months	after	Schwarzschild,	J.	Droste,	a	student	of	H.Lorentz,	gave	an	
about	 its	 properties	 [20]	(our	reference	[14])	 .	 In	 such	 a	 work	 Droste	 also	
(our	reference	[12]).		This	solution	had	a	peculiar	behaviour	and	what	is	now	
surface	was	not	quite	understood	at	the	time,	but	Hilbert	[22]	(our	reference	
[13])	claimed	that	the	forma	by	Droste	and	Weyl	was	preferable	in	[3]	(our	
reference	[6])	and	even	since	the	phrase	«	Schwarzschild	solution	»	has	been	
[2]	(our	reference	[26]).		
There	is	only	one	"Schwarzschild	solution",	which	is	presented	and	interpreted	in	
different	coordinate	systems.	In	1917	[12],	H.	Weyl	analysed	the	solution	of	Einstein's	
equation	in	vacuum,	taken	in	isolation,	in	an	attempt	to	geometrise	mass,	as	Einstein	and	
Rosen	did	in	1935	[15].	He	wrote	his	action	(his	equation	(2)	from	[12]):	
		
(82)																																																														
He	then	separates	the	two	elements	of	the	metric	according	to:	
(83)																																																																
He	specifies	the	hypothesis	concerning	the	length	element:		
		
(84)																																																												

claimed	that	his	solution	was	physically	equivalent	to	the	one	by	Schwarzschild.	
In	the	same	year,	1917,	H.Weyl	reobtained	the	same	solution	by	Droste	[21]	

called	the	Schwarzschild	radius,	where	it	becomes	singular,	,	meaning	that	the	
sum	of	the	terms	in	the	Einstein	equation	became	infinite.	The	nature	of	this

(86)																																																																			
where	2a	is	the	Schwarzschild	radius.	As	L.Flamm	did	in	1916	[10],	he	makes	a	plane	
section	of	the	3D	object	passing	through	the	origin	and	also	gives	the	equation	of	the	
meridian		:		
(87)																																																											
This	is	the	very	first	time	that	this	solution	has	been	considered	as	a	two-layer	coating,	
which	is	worth	mentioning.		
Let's	mention	Weyl	[12]:		
If	the	paraboloid	is	projected	orthogonally	on	the	z=0	plane	with	the	polar	
- 
coordinates	
	twice,	but	
does	not	cover	the	interior	at	all.		
				In	other	words,	this	projection	is	the	2D	two-folds	covering	of	a	non-contractile	variety	
with	a	circular	edge,	perimeter	
	.	He	then	introduced	a	second,	isotropic	coordinate	
system,	where	the	metric	of	this	"gravitational	space"	becomes	conformal	to	a	Euclidean	
space,	according	to	the	factor	:		
	(88)																																																																			
	This	(now	classic)	change	of	variable	is:

						However,	in	so	doing,	Weyl	expresses	the	metric	with	this	new	coordinate	which	he	
designates	by	the	letter	r	,	but	which	is	no	longer	the	R	coordinate	of	Schwarzschild	or	
from	Corda.	For	ease	of	reading,	we	will	keep	r'	and	write	:

to	the	value	a/2.	Of	course,	he	intends	to	use	this	geometry	to	describe	a	mass,	which	he	
therefore	imagines	to	have	an	exterior,	for	r'	>	a/2,	and	an	interior,	for	r	<	a/2.		The	most	
important	thing	is	that	he	envisages	the	values	of	
,	which	will	be	called	the	"time	
factor",	since	it	represents	the	coefficient	of	dt.	And	he	writes

Coefficient	which	would	therefore	become	negative	beyond	the	throat	sphere.	s	is	the	
length,	measured	along	the	geodesics	and	cannot	be	negative.	The	negativity	of	the	time	
factor	would	imply,	if	Schwarzschild's	geometry	leads	to	another	sheet	of	space-time,	that	
the	time	coordinate	reverses	at	the	passage	of	the	throat,	but	not	the	proper	time,	in	other	
words	that	the	two	sheets	are	T-symmetrical.	End	of	this	digression	regarding	the	
interpretation	of	Weyl's	solution.		However,	contrary	to	what	Corda	writes,	Weyl	does	not	
find	the	same	solution	as	Droste	and	Schwarzschild.	To	his	credit,	the	English	translation	
of	Weyl's	text	only	became	available	in	2012,	after	his	article	had	been	published.		
It	is	now	necessary	to	return	to	the	article	published	on	23	December	1916	[13].	Before	
1915,	Einstein	had	convinced	the	great	mathematician	David	Hilbert	that	the	use	of	
modern	geometry,	which	was	in	the	process	of	being	born,	would	shed	a	new	and	
powerful	light	on	physics.	It	should	also	be	remembered	that	in	1915	:		
-	We	only	know	two	forces,	the	force	of	gravity	and	the	electromagnetic	force.	
The	electron	has	just	been	discovered.

	-	We	have	no	idea	that	the	universe	can	evolve	over	time.		
	-	The	deviation	from	Euclidean	geometry	and	Newtonian	and	Maxwellian	
physics,	when	trains	run	on	steam,	is	just	a	tiny	phenomenon,	part	of	the	
philosophy	of	science,	with	no	immediate	physical	application.	
In	1915	Hilbert,	who	had	just	discovered	that	the	high	mathematics	he	championed	had	
some	application	in	physics,	applied	the	principle	of	least	action	to	electromagnetism	and	
gravitation.	In	an	article	entitled	"The	Foundations	of	Physics"	[27],	which	dealt	jointly	
with	gravitation	and	electromagnetism,	he	published	what	we	would	today	call	a	"Theory	
of	Everything".	In	it,	he	set	out	his	own	understanding	of	special	relativity:	what	did	he	
mean	by	the	presence	of	a	minus	sign	in	the	metric?	His	own	answer:	time	is	simply	
imaginary,	when	squared,	the	minus	sign	appears.	Whereas	Einstein	strove	to	show	that	
this	temporal	dimension	is	of	the	same	nature	as	the	other	three,	and	that	it	must	be	
measured	in	metres	and,	incidentally,	converted	into	seconds	by	dividing	by	a	constant:	c.	
So,	for	Hilbert,	space,	with	its	three	coordinates	
,	is	'prime'.	Time	is	just	another	
dimension,	grafted	onto	a	quasi-Euclidean	space.	The	relativistic	effects	do	not	appear	
until	the	very	end	of	the	calculation,	which	is	carried	out	with	dimensions	
,	
and	it	is	only	in	the	last	line	that	a	time	coordinate	appears,	according	to	
.	The	two	
articles,	from	1915	and	1916,	have	the	same	title:	"The	Foundations	of	Physics".	This	is	
Hilbert's	aim:	to	discover	the	ultimate	workings	of	the	universe,	which	is	governed	by	
what,	for	him,	takes	the	place	of	Nature	and	God:	logic.	Everything	is	governed	by	
mathematics,	which	reveals	its	facets	one	by	one	to	enable	man	to	understand	the	
universe.	The	key	words	are	completeness,	consistency	and	decidability.	Hence	the	motto	
of	an	absolute	intellectual	optimist,	which	will	be	engraved	on	his	tombstone	in	Göttingen			
For	him,	the	production	of	measurable	quantities,	in	this	case	time	itself,	is	the	work	of	
the	engineer.	What	counts	is	the	matrix	that	gives	birth	to	these	quantities.	And	this	matrix	
is	a	bilinear	form,	extraordinarily	compact	and	elegant.:		
(93)																																																									
		
For	Hibert,	the	metric	is	just	a	tiny	variation	on	the	Euclidean	metric,	associated	with	the	
.	Curvature	is	a	very	small	perturbation	:	
Kronecker	tensor
		
(94)																																																														
On	20	November	1915,	Hilbert	published	his	first	version	[27]	of	his	"Fundamentals	of	
Physics",	which	also	contained	the	field	equation,	to	the	great	displeasure	of	Einstein,	who	
published	the	same	equation	five	days	later	[8],	in	the	same	journal.	After	a	brief	moment	
of	hesitation	between	these	geniuses	who	had	become	friends,	Hilbert	decided	that	

Wir	müssen	wissen,	wir	werden	wissen

Einstein	alone	would	retain	the	paternity	of	what	would	serve	as	the	basis	for	general	
relativity.	But	in	early	1916	Schwarzschild	published	the	first	exact	solution	to	this	
equation	[4].	Hilbert	then	decided	to	publish	a	second	version	of	his	article,	with	the	same	
title	[13],	which	incorporated	Schwarzschild's	result.	But	he	focused	his	attention	only	on	
the	exterior	metric	[4],	completely	neglecting	the	February	paper	on	the	interior	metric	
	.	
[5].	Moving	on	to	polar	coordinates,	he	denoted	these	new	coordinates	by	
It	is	important	to	quote	this	key	passage	in	which	he	presents	his	bilinear	form	:	
		
(95)																	
l	is	the	time	coordinate,	which	becomes	it	a	little	further	on.	The	
has	disappeared.	At	
this	stage	the	"signature"	is	Euclidean:	
.	At	this	stage	Hilbert	has	three	functions	
of	r	to	determine.	With	what	follows,	he	reduces	this	number	to	two	:	
where	
		
	(96)																																										
(97)																			
This	approach	was	described	as	an	error	by	L.S.	Abrams	[29]	and	later	commented	on	by	
S.	Antoci	[30].	This	is	not	an	error,	but	a	simple	change	in	Schwarzschild's	notation	from	
to	the	system	
the	polar	co-ordinate	system	
.	It	
remains	for	Hilbert	to	provide	the	result	of	his	calculation

which,	in	the	post-war	period,	was	generalized	to	the	whole	of	theoretical	physics,	
without	it	being	possible	to	mention	an	article	in	which	this	transformation	was	justified.

	8	–	Conclusion	
In	this	article	we	have	tried	to	explain	the	ins	and	outs	of	black	hole	theory.	What	can	we	
say	about	the	only	two	data	available	([2],	[3])?	These	images	do	not	fit	in	with	the	very	
large	number	of	computer-generated	images	available.	We	can	try	to	account	for	the	
strong	darkening	of	the	central	parts,	which	evokes,	for	both	images,	an	increase	in	
wavelength	 by	 gravitational	 redshift	 corresponding	 to	
.	 Referring	 to	
Schwarzschild's	solution	for	the	interior	metric	[5],	we	obtain	;	
(113)	
	
its	
in	other	words,	a	subcritical	object	whose	mass	would	be	equal	to	
Schwarzschild	radius,	and	where	the	force	of	gravity	would	therefore	be	balanced	by	the	
very	strong	rise	in	pressure	at	its	centre.	What	remains	to	be	done	is	to	construct	the	
scenario	that	would	allow	the	formation	of	such	objects,	which	would	not	be	giant	black	
holes.
