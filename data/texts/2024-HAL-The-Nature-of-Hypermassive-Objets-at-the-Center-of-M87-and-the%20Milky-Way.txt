Abstract	:	Focusing	on	the	Sgr	A*	and	M87	images	of	hypermassive	objects	at	the	center	
of	M87,	we	note	a	divergence	from	an	identification	with	images	of	giant	black	holes,	as	
well	as	the	identity,	in	both	cases,	of	the	value	3,	representing	the	ratio	of	maximum	to	
minimum	temperature.	It	is	suggested	that	these	are	subcritical	objects,	where	the	
darkening	of	their	central	part	derives	from	the	fact	that	their	radius	is	(8/9)1/2	Rs.	Under	
these	conditions,	a	very	strong	pressure	gradient	can	oppose	the	force	of	gravity.	We	
suggest	a	scheme	for	the	formation	of	your	objects.

1	–	Introduction	
The	kinematics	of	the	objects	orbiting	the	central	part	of	the	M87	and	Milky	Way	galaxies	
are	sufficiently	well	documented	that	the	mass	values	responsible	for	such	observations	
cannot	be	questioned.	Nevertheless,	when	the	first	images	appeared,	in	2019[1]	and	2022	
[2],	magazines	headlined	"Shadow	of	Giant	Black	Holes".	The	only	reason	given	was	that	
no	other	interpretation	was	possible.	But	the	central	parts	of	these	objects	are	far	from	
black.

If	it's	perhaps	problematic	to	give	credence	to	the	temperature	values	displayed,	we	can	
evaluate	the	ratio	of	maximum	and	minimum	temperatures	in	each	image	and	find	values	
very	close	to	3.	Some	have	tried	to	justify	this	central	temperature	by	the	presence	of	the	
hot	accretion	disk	in	the	foreground.	But	why	doesn't	it	reveal	its	presence	in	the	vicinity	
of	the	object?		In	[3],	an	attempt	was	made	to	reconstruct	the	characteristics	of	the	“most	
likely	black	hole”,	giving	what	we	would	expect	to	see	if	the	presence	of	hot	gas	in	the	
background	did	not	interfere	with	the	observation:

	2	–	Identification	with	subcritical	objects.		
That's	one	way	of	interpreting	observations.	Another	is	to	stick	strictly	to	the	available	
data.	We	can	then	link	the	darkening	of	the	central	part	to	a	gravitational	redshift	effect.	
Under	these	conditions,	we	can	deduce	the	relationship	between	the	object's	radius	and	
the	corresponding	value	of	the	Schwarzschild	radius	related	to	its	mass:		
(1)																																																
The	object	could	therefore	be	a	subcritical	object,	as	described	by	Karl	Schwarzschild	in	
his	second	paper	[4],	describing	the	geometry	inside	a	sphere	filled	with	an	
incompressible	fluid	of	constant	density.	In	[5],	we	find	the	shape	of	the	pressure	curve,	
which	tends	towards	infinity	at	the	center,	when	this	critical	situation	is	reached.

	If	we	assimilate	these	hypermassive	objects	to	perfect	gases,	the	pressure,	assuming	that	
the	matter	density	r	is	constant,	or	varies	little,	represents	a	measure	of	the	volumetric	
density	of	thermal	agitation	energy,	with	a	velocity	v:		
	
(2)																																																																			
Going	back	in	time,	the	Big	Bang	model	shows	a	succession	of	increasingly	dense	and	hot	
states.	The	dominant	pressure	soon	becomes	radiation	pressure.:		
	
(3)																																																																								
To	take	this	further,	it	is	necessary	to	consider	that	the	speed	of	light	can	be	considered	
as	variable,	under	extreme	conditions.	In	[5],	we	refuse	to	consider	that	this	pressure	
surge	has	a	physical	character,	arguing	that	the	speed	of	sound	in	this	medium	would	then	
exceed	that	of	light,	considered	as	an	absolute	constant.	In	his	article	of	February	1916	
[4],	however,	K.	Schwarzschild	considers	this	possibility.	Within	the	mass,	he	uses	an	
angular	coordinate	
(4)																																											
then	refers	to	the	speed	of	light	outside	the	object.	The	interior	metric	is	then

The	SO(3)-invariant	solution	to	Einstein's	equation	corresponds	to	a	3D	object	translating	
along	the	time	coordinate.	This	object	is	made	up	of	two	connected	sets.	The	first	is	a	
portion	of	the	hypersphere	S3,	with	radius	of	curvature	
.	The	second	is	a	portion	of	a	
Flamm	hypersurface	whose	meridian	is	a	lying	parabola.	Two	criticalities	thus	emerge.	
The	first	is	that	envisaged	by	proponents	of	black	hole	theory.	The	conditions	then	
become	such	that	
.	We'll	call	this	"geometric	criticality	".	The	meridian	
then	becomes	:

Fig.7	:	Geometric	criticality.	

	But	even	before	this	"geometrical	criticality"	occurs,	the	"physical	criticality"	mentioned	
by	Schwarzschild	[4]	comes	into	play,	corresponding	to	an	 angle	value	close	to

We	reproduce	below	the	portion	of	the	meridian	curve	given	in	[5].

If	we	retain	this	idea	of	a	steep	rise	in	the	value	of	the	speed	of	light	inside	the	object,	the	
corresponding	pressure	gradient	is	therefore	able	to	oppose	the	force	of	gravity.	In	his	
article,	Schwarzschld	denotes	the	time	coordinate	by	
	and	the	corresponding	
coefficient	of	his	metric	by	f4	:

Fig.9	:	Schwarzschild	line	element	[4].		

	
	
This	coefficient	is	referred	to	in	the	literature	[5]	as	the	square	of	a	so-called	time	factor.	
Schwarzschild	gives	its	evolution	according	to:		
	

Fig.10	:	Time	factor	evolution	after		Schwarzschild	[4].	

	
It	can	be	seen	that	this	time	factor	tends	towards	zero	when	physical	criticality	conditions	
are	reached.	In	the	figure	below,	we	show	the	evolution	of	this	time	factor,	for	different	
mass	values:

The	authors	[5]limited	themselves	to	the	value	of	critical	mass.	But	let's	see	what	happens	
when	we	push	beyond	it,	what	would	happen	if	such	an	object	suddenly	benefited	from	a	
slight	increase	in	mass:	

	
	The	time	factor	then	becomes	negative	inside	a	small	sphere	centered	on	the	origin,	
whose	radius	is	growing	extremely	fast:

9	
	
	3	–	A	self-stability	mechanism.			
What	is	the	significance	of	this	negative	time	factor?	The	first	to	consider	this	possibility	
was	H.	Weyl,	in	1917	[7].	He	too	presented	the	equation	for	the	meridian	of	the	
hypersurface:		

	

Fig.14	:	Weyl,	meridian	equation	[7]	

	He	was	also	the	first	to	give	an	expression	for	the	exterior	metric	using	isotropic	
coordinates,	and	it	was	in	this	form	that	he	envisaged	the	negative	passage	of	the	time-
factor,	for	him	on	the	Schwarzschild	sphere	(r	=	a/2	).	
	

Fig.15	:	Weyl	time-factor,	in	isotropic	coordinates	[7].	

	
	For	our	purposes,	this	inversion	of	the	time	factor	concerns	the	interior	metric.	Let's	
consider	a	stationary	observer	in	this	central	region.	The	evolution	of	proper	time	
corresponds	to:		
(5)																																																											
The	time	factor,	identified	with	the	length	s,	cannot	be	reversed	(you	can't	turn	back	along	
a	geodesic).	If	geodesics	are	to	be	extended	into	the	region	where	the	time	factor	reverses,	
this	can	only	be	done	by	inverting	the	time	coordinate	t.	Its	inversion	is	now	widely	
considered,	as	is	the	existence	of	a	second	T-symmetric	universe	([8]	to	[13]).	Theoretical	
physicists	are	now	considering	a	possible	interaction	between	these	two	folds	by	
"entanglement",	which	would	then	justify	the	acceleration	of	the	universe's	expansion.	In	
[14],	[15],	this	interaction	is	based	on	a	two-folds	configuration	of	the	universe,	the	benefit

Leading	to	geodesics	that	evoke	repulsion.		The	situation	becomes	clearer.	When	matter	
is	added,	a	passageway	is	created	in	the	central	part	of	the	object.	The	masses	found	there

Fig.16	:	Plugstar.	

	This	model	is	opposed	to	the	interpretation	of	images	of	hypermassive	objects	as	giant	
black	holes,	but	has	the	advantage	of	being	consistent	with	observational	data.	It's	quite	
remarkable	that,	while	the	masses	and	temperatures	of	these	two	objects	differ	
significantly,	their	maximum/minimum	temperature	ratios	are	so	close.		
	
	4	–	On	the	formation	of	hypermassive	objects	and	quasars.		
Until	now,	the	idea	was	that	these	objects,	considered	to	be	giant	black	holes,	must	have	
formed	by	the	merger	of	so-called	stellar	black	holes.	But	the	discovery	of	such	
hypermassive	objects	at	an	age	of	the	universe	of	only	a	few	hundred	million	years	made	
this	scenario	difficult	to	envisage.	The	term	primordial	black	holes	was	then	suggested	
[19].	But	the	term	"primordial"	gives	little	information	about	how	these	objects	would	
have	formed.	In	the	context	of	this	bimetric	model	[17],	we	are	currently	studying	a	
scenario	in	which	joint	fluctuations	in	metrics	are	involved.	In	this	model,	galaxy	
confinement	is	ensured	not	by	positive-mass	dark	matter	halos,	but	by	the	fact	that	these	

If	the	proposed	model	is	correct,	we	conjecture	that	the	same		

will	be	true	for	all	future	images	of	hypermassive	objects.

galaxies	are	lodged	in	gaps	forming	in	the	negative-mass	distribution.	Joint	fluctuations	
in	metrics	affect	the	"apparent	mass	factor"
When	it	is	weakened,	the	confinement	loosens	and	the	galaxy	breaks	up.	This	leads	to	the	
formation	of	irregular	galaxies.	When,	on	the	other	hand,	the	confinement	factor	is	
strengthened,	a	centripetal	density	wave	is	formed,	of	which	the	Hoag	galaxy	could	be	an	
example.

	This	density	wave	becomes	stronger	as	it	approaches	the	galactic	center.	As	it	passes,	it	
gives	rise	to	new	stars,	and	it	is	the	UV	radiation	it	emits	which,	by	exciting	the	gas,	reveals	
its	presence,	as	in	the	case	of	spiral	waves.	If	the	magnetic	Reynolds	number	is	locally	high,	
the	wave	will	pick	up	all	the	lines	of	force	corresponding	to	the	weak	magnetic	field	pre-
existing	in	the	galaxy.

	When	convergence	is	complete,	a	hot,	dense	object	is	created	at	the	center	of	the	galaxy,	
where	fusion	reactions	result	in	plasma	emission,	focused	along	the	two	lobes	by	the	very	
powerful	magnetic	field	.	So	that	we	get	a	quasar.		The	magnetic	field	gradient	transforms	
these	plasma	jets	into	natural	particle	gas	accelerators,	birthplaces	of	cosmic	rays.	Excess	
mass	is	eliminated	by	the	plugstar	phenomenon,	generating	a	powerful	gravitational	
wave.	This	would	correspond	to	the	object	at	the	center	of	galaxy	M87.	After	a	while,	the	
plasma	emission	ceases.	If	fluctuations	occur	again,	the	mechanism	resumes	and	plasma	
emission	from	the	quasar	is	sporadic,	as	appears	to	be	the	case	for	87.	In	a	future	article,	
we'll	present	the	theory	of	joint	metric	fluctuations.	What	emerges	is	that	the	
phenomenon	is	all	the	more	important	in	that	in	the	most	primitive	state	of	the	universe,	
this	last	would	be		extremely	agitated	and	turbulent.	On	the	scale	of	a	galaxy,	density	
waves	generate	new	stars.	But	on	a	much	larger	scale,	galaxy	rings	are	formed,	like	the	
one	recently	discovered	[20].	
		5	-	Conclusion.		
We	consider	two	images	of	hypermassive	objects	located	at	the	center	of	galaxies	M87	
and	Milky	Way,	immediately	identified	as	so-called	giant	black	holes.	Noting	the	identity	
for	these	two	objects	of	the	value	3	of	the	ratio	of	maximum	temperature	to	minimum	
temperature,	and	assimilating	the	darkening	effect	of	their	central	part,	we	show	that	
these	could	be	subcritical	objects	whose	radius	would	then	be	
,	such	that	the	
enormous	rise	in	pressure	towards	the	center	would	then	allow	it	to	balance	the	force	of	
gravity.	Anticipating	the	future	publication	of	works	reporting,	in	a	bimetric	model,	joint	
fluctuations	of	these,	modifying	the	apparent	mass	coefficient	
,	we	evoke	a	
possible	formation	scheme	of	such	objects,	resulting	from	the	formation	of	a	centripetal	
density	wave,	giving	birth	to	a	quasar	when	it	reaches	the	center.	The	object	Sgr	A*	would	
thus	be	an	extinct	quasar.
