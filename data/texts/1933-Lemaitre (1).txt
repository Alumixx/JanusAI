The Expan din g Un iverse²

by the Ab b Âe Georges Lem aÃ

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMA RY

In this paper we do not int end to discuss the hypot heses on which the
theory of the expansion of the Universe is based, or the value of the as-
tronom ical evidence which support s it. Such a discussion seems to us at
present premat ure and it certainly could not arrive at de® nit ive conclusions
in t he present state of t he theory and the observat ions.

T he theory can be developed in two ways: by the study of exact
solut ions of the gravit at ional equat ions, providing simpli® ed models, or
by approxim ate expansion of the solut ion of more complex problem s. It
seems to us useful not to mix these two methods, and in this paper we will
be concerned only with mathemat ically exact solut ions. W hen we want to
apply these to real problem s, we will have to appeal t o physical int uit ion
in order to reduce an overcomplicat ed problem to a simpli® ed model for
which we have a solut ion. Many of our result s seem to be able to serve
as starting point s for t he methods of expansion in series which we hop e to
treat in a lat er pap er.

In the ® rst two sections, we give in detail the tensor calculat ions which
we shall need, and which we summarize in Section 3,
in the course of
int roducing the not ation which makes manifest the analogy between the
relat ivist ic result s and the classical formulae.

We then int roduce the concept of a quasi-st atic ® eld which immedi-
ately allows us to generalize the known st atic solut ions by allowing adia-

bat ic variat ions in them. We give a solut ion, probably new, for the case of
a sphere with const ant radial pressure, and we use it to highlight Schwarz-
schild’ s paradox and to prove that t he very severe lim itation on the radius
of a given mass which is int roduced by the solut ion of the int erior problem
vanishes when one does not imp ose on the matter the condit ion of being in
the ¯ uid state.1 We describe put ting stress int o the Einst ein universe, as-
sumed to be ¯ uid, so that the rest mass2 of the universe decreases wit hout
changing the volume or dist urbing the equilibrium.

In Section 6, we summarize and complet e the result s obt ained in our
doct oral thesis (unpublished ), present ed in 1927 at the Massachuset ts In-
st itute of Technology, which concern a modi® cation of the Schwarzschild
int erior problem prop osed by Edddingt on.3

Section 7 concerns the in¯ uence of the format ion of local condensa-
tions on the breakdown of the equilibrium of an Einst ein universe: we
recover our result (Mon thly Notices 9 1 , 490 (1931) ) that t he pressure at
the neut ral zone is the determining factor in the breakdown, while elimi-
nat ing the technical complicat ions which clut tered up our original proof.
In Section 8 we study the evolut ion of spherical condensat ions in an
expanding universe under t he hypot hesis t hat pressure is negligible, and
rediscover as a part icular case the Friedmann universe.

We then int egrat e the Friedmann equat ion by Weierst rass’ s ellipt ic
funct ions in Section 9 and put the equat ions in a form adapt ed to num erical
calculat ions.

In Section 10, we int roduce the hypot hesis that clust ers of galaxies
are in equilibrium . T his hypot hesis can be checked by observat ion, and
108 solar masses as the average
the result is favourable. One obt ains 7 £
mass of the nebulae and 13 as the expansion coe(cid:141) cient of the universe.4
We indicat e how this new hypot hesis can give cosmological signi® cance
to the relat ive frequency of clust ers and isolat ed galaxies, and so remove the

uncert ainty which remains in the expansion law. We then calculat e, under
various hypot heses, the expansion t ime and the radius of t he universe.

T he hypot hesis of equilibrium of the nebulae seems to exclude the
critical case for which the equilibrium radius would great ly exceed a billion
light -years. We establish the result that in the critical case the dist ance
at the moment of equilibrium of the most widely separat ed point s which
can exchange light during expansion is still several billion light -years.

In Section 11, we remove an apparent cont radict ion between Fried-
mann’ s theory and the solut ion of Schwarzschild ’ s exterior problem . In the
lat t er, a mass such as that of the universe cannot have a radius less than
a billion light years. We show that t he singularity of the Schwarzschild
ext erior is an apparent singularity due to the fact that one has imposed a
st atic solut ion and that it can be eliminat ed by a change of coordinat es.5
In Section 12, we discuss the possibility of the universe reaching the

theoret ical zero of radius.

With the help of an anisot ropic model of the universe suggest ed to
us by Einst ein, we show that anisot ropy only precipit at es cont raction.
Analysing the various forces which could stop cont raction of a universe
whose radius is decreasing to zero, we arrive at the conclusion t hat only
the non-Maxwellian forces which prevent the int erpenet ration of the fun-
dament al part icles of matt er seem to be capable of put ting an end to the
cont raction, when the radius of the universe is reduced to the size of the
solar system.

We thus conclude that the origin of the earth is lat er than such an
event and this forces us to discard the solut ions where the radius of the
universe is much smaller than the equilibrium radius and in part icular
discard the quasi-p eriodic solut ions.

1. CALCULATION OF THE RIEMANN TENSOR

T he calculat ions simplify considerably if one not ices t hat the am , which
are not tensors under a general coordinat e transform at ion, are nevert heless
covariant s of t he ® rst order for the special t ransformat ions of the form

where c1 , c2 , c3 , and c4 are const ant s.

For these special transform ations, t he expressions

expression for R i

In what follows, we suspend the usual summation convent ion for in-

dices denot ed by Latin let ters.

T he complet ely cont racted scalar R is obt ained by making the further

2. SPHERICAL SYMMETRY

By spherical symmetry, we mean the case where two of t he coordinat es

x2 and x3 appear in the ds 2 only through the expression

dx2

2 + sin2 x2 dx 2

3

(2.1)

or an equivalent expression.

T he ds 2 is thus invariant under the transform ations of x2 and x3 which
leave this expression invariant and which form the group of rotations of a
unit sphere about it s centre.

In this case a1 , a2 , and a4 are funct ions of x1 and x4 only, and

All the derivat ives wit h respect to x3 are thus zero, as are the deriva-

tives with respect to x2 , except for the ® rst derivat ives

a3 = a2 sin x2 .

¶ a3

T he coordinat es x1 and x4 are so far chosen arbit rarily.
When the matt er tensor is non-zero, there is a nat ural split int o space
and time imposed by t he matter; one can in fact determine the worldlines
such that if one chooses x1 const ant along those lines one has T14 = 0. T he
curves of const ant x4 are then the orthogonal trajectories of the curves of
const ant x1 .

In what follows, we will st ick to the study of t he ® eld when the coor-

dinat es have been thus chosen.

It is import ant to not e t hat this way of working does not reduce the

generality of the result s obt ained at all.

In certain cases, the choice of coordinat es may be more or less inde-
terminat e. It can also happen that the int roduct ion of these coordinat es
produces analyt ical singularit ies which demand special study.

For the coordinat es such that T14 = 0 it is convenient t o make use of

the conservat ion theorem

3. SUMMA RY OF R ESULTS FOR SPHERICAL SYMMET RY

Before discussing the equat ions we have just obt ained and showing
their signi® cance and the analogies t hey provide wit h the formulae of clas-
sical mechanics, we must go back through them using not ation better
adapt ed to applicat ions.

Let us consider a ds 2 of t he form

ds 2 = ± a2 dx 2 ±

r 2 ( dh 2 + sin2 h dw 2 ) + c2 dt2 .

(3.1)

± r 2 , and ± c2 are t he funct ions of x1 = x and x4 = t previously

± a2 ,
denot ed by a2

1 , a2

2 , and a2

4 . We also write

T 4

4 = r,

T 1

1 = ± p,

T 2
2 = T 3

3 = ± t.

(3.2)

Einst ein’ s const ant is

k =

8pK
c2
0

where K is the gravit ational const ant and c0 the speed of light . In place
of F we int roduce a funct ion m = ± 4piF

.

T he equat ions (2.10) and (2.11) are written in this manner

T his equat ion is part icularly useful when ¶ r / ¶ t vanishes,

(3.7) still applies in this case.

In this form, t he equat ions become remarkably int uit ive. T he coor-
dinat e x is attached to the mat ter and plays the role of init ial values of
coordinat es in classical hydrodynam ics.
r is analogous to t he dist ance
variable from the origin; in fact, r is the dist ance that can be evaluat ed
st arting from t he norm al measures of a radius vector. Equat ions (3.5) and
(3.7) are therefore the equat ions of motion of the matter, m corresponding
to the mass within a moving material sphere of radius x .

T he equat ion (3.8) is analogous to the balance equat ion, (1/ c)(¶ c/ ¶ x )
playing the role of the gravit ational force remaining aft er the removal of
the eŒect of the moving frame.6

(5.9)

When the funct ions f 1 (t) and f 2 (t), or at least their ratio, are reduced

to a const ant , one recovers Schwarzschild’ s known result s.

For f 2 (t) = 0 and kr = 2l, we obt ain the Einst ein universe.

If
we make f 2 (t) vary, we obt ain a progressive loading of t he universe, the
pressure varying according to t he law

p =

rf 2 (t) cos x

f 1 (t) ±

f 2 (t) cos x

.

(5.10)

One can imagine t his pressure to be exert ed at the origin x = 0, and
dist ribut ing itself throughout the incom pressible ¯ uid while maint aining
the equilibrium. The pressure decreases outwards from t he centre, and
vanishes at the polar plane of the centre, x = p/ 2.

T hings happen diŒerent ly for an Einst ein universe of the simple ellipt ic
form or for a universe wit h dist inct ant ipodal point s. In t he lat ter case, x
varies from 0 to p and the pressure is diŒerent in the two part s separat ed
by the plane x = p/ 2; it is negat ive in the other half of the space, and
diŒerent in absolut e value at corresponding point s.

T hese result s are nat urally without direct int erest in the study of the
real universe, which can never be compared with an incom pressible ¯ uid.
T hey have however the int erest of showing how t he universe could stay in
equilibrium even though its rest mass varies.

T his itself is easily calculat ed; one has

M (x ) =

4pa3 (r ± 3p) sin2 x dx ,

For f 1 = 0 and r = 0 we obt ain t he de Sit ter universe.
A consequence of t he Schwarzschild int erior solut ion is that it appears
to impose, for the minimum radius of a sphere of given mass, a more severe
lim it than that imposed by t he exterior solut ion.

T his limit is obt ained for

in which case the pressure is in® nit e at the centre.

One has then (for l = 0) by (5.8)

f 1 (t) = f 2 (t),

cos x 1 = 1
3 ,

whence, for the corresp onding radius,

r = a sin x 1 = a

8/ 9 ,

while t he exterior problem allows a radius of what ever mult iple of a one
likes.

T his limit ation holds only because one has supp osed t he matter to be

a ¯ uid.

Let us consider, in fact, matter maint aining itself like an arch under
the action of transversal forces. T he radial pressure p can be zero or more
generally const ant .

In this case, the equat ion (5.8) can still be int egrat ed and gives

c = f 3 (t)[cos x ]- ( 1/ 2 ) ( 1- l a 2 + k p a 2 ) ,

while t he balance equat ion (3.8) gives

One can thus const ruct a sphere supp orting itself by transversal ten-

sions and ®

lling space as complet ely as one wishes.

T he lower limit of radius for a given mass is thus determined by the
ext erior ® eld and not by t he solut ion of the int erior problem , if one does
not impose the condit ion that the matter is ¯ uid. T he two solut ions can
be combined. One can imagine a liquid, water for exam ple, part of which
is frozen and forms concent ric spheres of ice which are self-supp orting,
independently of one anot her, by normal tensions. T hese spheres are then
adiabat ically melted starting from the centre, giving the Schwarzschild
¯ uid. T he Schwarzschild solut ion can at each inst ant be relat ed to the
solut ion p = 0 by choosing suit ably the values of the funct ions f 1 (t),
f 2 (t), f 3 (t). One can thus progressively increase the radius of the melted
region unt il the central pressure becomes in® nit e and the Schwarzschild
problem has no solut ion. T his shows clearly the really paradoxical nat ure
of Schwarzschild ’ s result .

T he solut ions x = y = ± 2, and x = y = ± 3 correspond respectively

to the Einst ein and de Sit ter universes.

It is equally easy to study the behaviour of x and y for large values
of these variables. One can t hen neglect t he num erical terms added to x

T he solut ion of this equat ion correspondin g to ® nit e init ial values of
x and y is the part icular solut ion passing t hrough t he origin.
It is easy
to discuss the behaviour of this solut ion and show that , st arting from the
origin at an angle of 45±, it winds round in an ant iclockwise 7 spiral and
tends asym ptotically to the point

From this it follows that X passes successively through a maximum
X 1 , a minimum X 2 , etc., and that the curves of x are successively t angent
to hyperb olae

x =

X k
u

.

When one varies the init ial values, the point s of cont act are displaced

and the hyperbolae form so many envelop es of the curves of x.

One may expect t hat these general charact eristics survive in the form

of the solut ions even when x and y are no longer small.

In fact,

it follows from the num erical calculat ions which were the
sub ject of an unpublished thesis, present ed in 1927 to the Massachuset ts
Inst itute of Technology, that the ® rst envelop e can be represent ed up to
values of x close to ± 2 by the formula

x =

while t he asym ptot ic lim it can be expanded in a series

x =

± 2.8571 + 0.168u + 0.22u 2 + . . .

7u

From t his it follows that when one increases the cent ral pressure, the
radius (p = 0) at ® rst increases, passes through a maximum on the ® rst
envelope, then decreases to the second envelope, then increases again and
tends in an oscillat ory manner t o a lim it point on t he lim it of the envelopes.

For l = 0, the ® rst maximum takes place at

and the lim it ing point is at

u = 0.083

u = 0.05.

One can easily enough give an account of the mechanism of this ap-

parent ly paradoxical result .

When t he central pressure increases, one nat urally t ends to increase
the radius, but at the same time one increases the energy cont ent of the
matt er

r = d + 3p.

T he gravit ational eŒect of this energy event ually compensat es the eŒect of
the pressure and the two in¯ uences take turns to prevail.

In other words, under Eddingt on’ s hypot hesis there is no longer any
quest ion of adiabat ic variat ions; one cannot increase the pressure wit hout

6 5 8

adding energy to the exterior and the gravit ational eŒect of this addit ional
energy event ually dominat es.

For cert ain radii, there exist several equilibrium con® gurat ions; it is
not clear whether these con® gurat ions are unst able, except for that of
minimum energy.

7. INSTA BILITY OF THE EINSTEIN UNIVER SE

Having studied t he quasi-st atic spherical ® elds, we int end to exam ine
how the breakdown of equilibrium of a quasi-st at ic ® eld can be produced
and in part icular the breakdown of the equilibrium of the Einst ein universe.
We imagine that by a process which we try to keep as general as
possible one modi® es either the equat ion of state of t he mat ter or its dis-
tribut ion. We supp ose that at the moment of the breakdown of equilibrium
one has still

(7.1)

(7.2)

and consequent ly

as for t he quasi-st atic ® elds; but these relat ions are no longer maint ained
as ident ities. We go back to (3.7) for the accelerat ion, and, taking account
of the relat ions (7.1) and (7.2) , we see t hat the breakdown of equilibrium
can only come about through a modi® cation of p or ¶ c/ ¶ x.

We have seen above exam ples of such modi® cations, but then these

modi® cat ions were adjust ed so as not to upset the equilibrium .

It is clear that if p and ¶ c/ ¶ x do not change, it is impossible to break
equilibrium , and that is true even if p and ¶ c/ ¶ x change at point s other
than the one under considerat ion. If one sets the int erior region in motion,
for exam ple, taking care to preserve t he spherical symmetry, that will have
no eŒect on the ext erior region, since the pressure and the force of gravity
¶ c/ ¶ x would not be modi® ed there.

T he condit ion

¶ c
¶ x

= 0

can still be considered as the condit ion that the worldlines with const ant
x de® ned by t he matt er are geodesics.

To study the breakdown of t he equilibrium of the Einst ein universe
due to the eŒect of the format ion of local condensat ions dist ribut ed uni-
formly in space, we imagine a large number of centres of condensat ion

T h e E x p a n d in g U n i v e r s e

6 5 9

dist ribut ed more or less uniform ly. There is no way to suppose them dis-
tribut ed in a perfectly homogeneous manner for, in an ellipt ic space, there
lling spheres 8 of Eu-
is no equivalent of the cubic lat tices or the space-®
clidean space. But stat istically the dist ribut ion can be assum ed uniform.
T he condensat ion process is supp osed to develop in a similar manner
around each centre of condensat ion, and t here nat urally exist s a network
of surfaces, forming cells around the cent res of condensat ion, which are
the loci of point s which are no more under the in¯ uence of one of the two
condensat ions which they separat e than the other. T hese cells form the
neut ral zone between the gravit at ional ® elds of the condensat ions.

By virt ue of the global hom ogeneity which we have assumed,

it is
clear that all the cells behave in the same way; they are all in equilibrium,
or they dilat e or cont ract toget her. It thus su(cid:141) ces to consider just one of
them in order to work out the equilibrium or motion of the whole universe.
Fixing our attention on one cell, the neut ral zone of a part icular con-
densat ion, we suppose that that condensat ion enjoys spherical symmetry,
and that we can take account of the in¯ uence of neighbouring conden-
sations by replacing them with a spherically symmetric dist ribut ion of
matt er. T he neut ral zone is then a sphere.

T he point s of this sphere enjoy t he prop erty that their worldlines are
geodesics, or that the force of gravity st ill vanishes there, since neit her the
int ernal condensat ion nor the neighbouring condensat ions have a prepon-
derant in¯ uence t here. One must thus have at the neut ral zone

¶ c
¶ x

= 0,

and consequent ly the equilibrium can only be broken if t he modi® cations
int roduced int o the state of the matter have made p, the radial pressure
at the neut ral zone, vary.

T hus if we want to compare a universe which is globally hom ogeneous
but cont ains a large number of uniformly dist ribut ed condensat ions wit h
the perfectly hom ogeneous Einst ein universe, we have t o consider the net-
work of cells formed by the neut ral zones separat ing the condensat ions.
T he homogeneous universe must, so to say, be tangent at those point s to
the universe present ing the condensat ions, and the pressure normal to the
neut ral zones must be t he pressure adopt ed for the hom ogeneous universe.
T hen the equilibrium , or the expansion, of the hom ogeneous universe gives
us the equilibrium or expansion of the network of neut ral zones.

8 In the original, `piles de b oulet s’

õ t r e

T he two universes can have diŒerent masses or diŒerent volum es. One
can conclude not hing from that , t he determining factor being the pressure
at the neut ral zone.

T he int erest of this result is that it is complet ely independent of the
part icular process which the development of the condensat ions follows
from.
It provides t he means, for any part icular process, to foresee the
eŒect of that process on the equilibrium of the universe.

In part icular if the pressure is zero and remains zero in the neut ral
zones, the condensat ions do not aŒect the equilibrium. T he radial pres-
sure at the neut ral zone is the energy density crossing t hat zone, and thus
measures the int ensity of the exchanges between condensat ions. We have
called a reduct ion of such exchanges of energy a `stagnat ion of the uni-
verse’ . Only this process of stagnat ion can determine the breakdown of
the equilibrium in the sense of expansion.

8. CONDENSATIONS IN THE EX PA NDING UNIVER SE

In applicat ions to the real universe the pressure is generally negligible
compared with the density.
In the case of equilibrium we have had to
take it int o account , because the study of a breakdown of equilibrium
nat urally depends on minim al forces, but for the study of the expansion
of the universe and the developm ent of condensat ions in the course of the
expansion, we can neglect it.

In t his case, the equat ion (3.4) tells us t hat m is a funct ion only of x ,

and equat ion (3.8) , for p = t = 0, that c is a funct ion of t alone.

By means of a change of variable, we can thus assum e c const ant and

put

We then have, by (3.6)

When f (x ) = 1, the geom etry is thus Euclidean. T he equat ions then
diŒer from the equat ions of classical mechanics only by t he int roduct ion of
a cosmic repulsion and, in addit ion, by the fact that the const ant energy in
(8.2) , which, from the classical point of view, can have an arbit rary value,
is now zero.

In the general case, one still can consider r as the dist ance from the
origin, and the energy const ant at each material point , t hat is to say, at
each value of x , can be chosen arbit rarily. But the geom etry is t hen not
Euclidean. One can make a map of it in a Euclidean space where the
lengt hs normal to the radius vector are represent ed at their real size. T he
lengt hs along the radial vector are then represent ed at a scale

dr

ds

= f (x ).

T he radial lengt h scale depends only on x , that is to say it stays the
same for each material point throughout its motion, and it is linked to
the energy const ant in t he equat ion of motion of that point from equat ion
(8.2) .

T he coordinat e x can nat urally be chosen arbit rarily. W hen f (x ) is
less than or equal to one, one could choose the coordinat e x in such a way
that

f (x ) = cos x.

T his coordinat e choice is convenient when the space is closed. For
a space of the simple ellipt ic type, the whole space is described when x
varies from 0 to p/ 2.

It is import ant to not e that m is not the real mass within a sphere x ,
but rather t he mass calculat ed starting from the density without t aking
the curvat ure of the space int o account . T he real mass is

and, just like m , it is independe nt of time.

In the part icular case where m is proport ional to sin3 x , we have

where M = M (p/ 2) is the total mass of t he (simply ellipt ic) universe.

In this case, one can write

and one obt ains the Friedmann universe

Using the same method as in Section 7, we can st udy the development
of a condensat ion in the expanding universe. We assume this condensat ion
is spherically symmetric, and we replace t he exterior condensat ions by an
averaged density. T his comes back to assuming that m is proport ional to
sin3 x out side the condensat ion, but it follows anot her law in the central
region.

For the universe in the large, the trajectories of concent ric material
shells are homot hetic (8.7) . In the central region on the ot her hand, they
could equally well approach or move away from each ot her, so marking the
progress or attenuat ion of the condensat ion.

It may also happen that t he traject ories corresponding t o diŒerent
values of x come to cut one anot her. In this case our solut ion becomes
inadm issible, for x is a coordinat e and thus cannot have two values at
the same point . P hysically this means that the hypot hesis that we have

T h e E x p a n d in g U n i v e r s e

6 6 3

int roduced that the pressure is zero becomes inadm issible from a certain
value of x.

In part icular, if the trajectories fall back to the cent re, it will not be
permissible to treat the problem without int roducing pressure. Our aim is
simply to study the tendency of condensat ions to develop, rather t han to
follow their ® nal arrangem ent for which we can obviously no longer suppose
c ( the remaining gravit ational potential) t o be const ant , nor neglect the
rotational eŒects excluded by our hypot hesis of spherical symmetry.

It is well known that Friedm ann’ s equat ions adm it the following types

, when the root s of the right hand side

of solut ions:
1. unlim it ed expansion from 0 to ¥
of (8.21) are imaginary:
2. t he bounded case with coincident posit ive root s, r varying from zero to
the equilibrium radius, or from that equilibrium dist ance to in® nity;
3. the case of real root s:
(a) a branch bouncing from a minimum to in® nity, with as a lim iting case
the de Sit ter solut ion;
(b) a quasi-period ic branch from zero to a maximum .

T hese diŒerent event ualit ies arise according to whether

3K mÖ l

c2 sin3 x

is great er than, equal to, or less than one.

If, for exam ple, m is prop ortional to sin4 x , the central region will be
of the quasi-period ic type ® nally falling back int o t he centre, while the
ext erior region will be of the unlim it ed expansion type. Such a model thus
allows us, sub ject to the remarks made above, to study the format ion of
condensat ions in a universe of the unlim ited expansion type.

It is tempting to apply this model to the formation of the nebulae.
It seems however preferable to await a further developm ent of the the-
ory which will free us from the hypot hesis of spherical symmetry which
is manifest ly not realised by the spiral nebulae. T his development goes
out side the scop e of this article which considers only exact solut ions of the
gravit ational equat ions.

In the following sect ion, we expand the Friedm ann solut ion in terms of

it is the angular dist ance travelled by

10. THE CLUSTERS OF NEB ULA E

One of t he charact eristics of the universe which is revealed to us by
astronom ical observat ions is t hat , while there exist isolat ed nebulae, there
also are agglom erat ions of nebulae, the populat ion of which varies from
some tens up to hundreds of nebulae.

We int end to discuss the hyp ot hesis under which the clust ers of neb-
ulae would be essentially in equilibrium and have the form of a part of the

F
T h e E x p a n d in g U n i v e r s e

6 6 9

Einst ein universe. We prove in the sequel that some inform ation ab out
the expansion of the universe can be deduced from this hypot hesis.

If the clust ers are in equilibrium , the current radius of the universe is
clearly great er than the equilibrium radius, in such a way that the Hubble
ratio

r
v

= 1.8 £

109 years

(10.1)

between the dist ance of the nebulae and t heir spectroscopic velocity of
recession is a measure of the cosmological const ant . Adopt ing

l = 10- 5 4 ,

r 3
e =

3K m
lc2

r e = 80 3Ö m ,

we can calculat e from the formula (8.4) at what dist ance r e the cosmic re-
pulsion and the force of gravit ation due to a mass m come int o equilibrium;
one has

(10.2)

(10.3)

or

the dist ances being measured in light -years and the Sun’ s mass having
been taken as the unit .

If the clust ers of nebulae are in equilibrium , r e must be the radius
of t he neut ral zone corresp onding to each nebula. T he mean dist ance
between nebulae must thus be 2r e .

If t here are N nebulae dist ribut ed in a more or less spherical fashion,

the volume of the clust er must be

We can estimate the dist ance D and the angular diamet er d of the

(10.4)

If d is expressed in degress and D in megaparsecs, the diam et er in

Hubble’ s est imat es (Mount Wilson Cont r. no. 427) allow us to calcu-
lat e the mean mass of a galaxy under the hypot hesis of equilibrium. For
certain clust ers, the dat a of table IX do not agree with the inform at ion in
the t ext; we have then made the calculat ion for bot h values.

T hese dat a are clearly of very unequal value. In part icular, Shapley
® nds a very much larger dist ance and a smaller number of nebulae for the
Virgo clust er. However, for the Virgo clust ers A, B , C and D, Shapley
® nds diamet ers and numbers of nebulae of the same order of magnit ude.
If one t akes int o account the uncert ainty in the dat a on which we
are basing t he calculat ions, and in part icular the irregular form of most
clust ers, one can consider the result as favourable to the hypot hesis of the
equilibrium of the clust ers of nebulae.

T he num erical value of the mass found for the nebulae is of the order

of magnit ude indicat ed by Hubble’ s research.

T he dat a concerning the Coma clust er seem to be the most secure,
all t he more so as this clust er appears t o have quit e a globular form. We
thus adopt as our estimate of t he mean mass of nebulae

and thus, as the mean dist ance between the nebulae,

Comparing this value with the mean dist ance of the isolat ed nebulae,

estimated by Hubble as

0.7 109 K

,

140 000 light -years.

we have, as the coe(cid:141) cient of expansion of the universe

6 7 1

(10.6)

T he hypot hesis of clust er equilibrium thus seems to provide the means

of making precise, and con® rming, Hubble’ s estimat es.

It has also the int erest of providing a cosmological signi® cance to the

relat ive frequency of clust ers and isolat ed nebulae.

Without us having so far develop ed a truly precise theory, it is clear
that if the expansion is not much slowed down in the neighbourhood of
the equilibrium posit ion, it is alm ost impossible t hat the part s of the uni-
verse could have deviat ed in great numbers from the average motion at
the moment when they were in equilibrium , and perhaps one could prove
that if the expansion is t oo much slowed down in the neighbourhood of the
equilibrium , the clust ers would have to be more num erous and more im-
port ant than they really are. T hus there is here a new line of attack which
allows us to ® nd t he value of g2 , or at least exclude the neighb ourhood of
the two critical values g2 = ± 3 and g2 = 0.

T his su(cid:141) ces to det ermine the order of magnit ude of the radius of the

universe and t he expansion time.

which is Schwarzschild’ s form (11.1) for the ® eld of a point mass.

T he singularity is int roduced because the expression which app ears in

the denominat or of dt (11.6) vanishes for su(cid:141) cient ly small values of r .

t depends on an ellipt ic int egral. In the part icular case where l tends
to zero, t he int egrat ion can be carried out . To simplify matters, let us take
coordinat es for which K and c are equal to one.

12. THE VANISHING OF SPACE

T he radius of space may pass through zero. We int end to discuss this
passage, and t o examine in part icular if there is a way of int erpreting this
zero value of t he radius physically as simply represent ing a small quant ity
and, in this case, of ® xing its order of magnit ude.

For the st udy of the zero point , we may neglect the cosmological

When U varies from 0 to p, R returns t o its init ial zero value, and

light just has time t o go round the simply ellipt ic space.

T he quest ion is to know if there is a way t o smoot h out the cusp of

the cycloid.

One can ask ® rst of all,

if one would not obt ain this result if one
took int o account t he eŒect of the pressure which need not necessarily be
negligible.
It is easy t o see, going back to t he equat ion (3.7) , that the

Such a universe is nat urally inadmissib le from many point s of view,
it has the int erest of int roducing a marked and largely arbit rary

anisot ropy.

We can easily calculat e the matter tensor by the formulae of Sect ion 1.

One sees that anisot ropy can no more prevent the vanishing of space

than pressure can.

T he above argum ent is not a formal proof of the impossibility of avoid-
ing zero volum e by anisot ropy, since (12.5) is not the most general conceiv-
able form, but it indicat es all the same that in an already rat her general
case anisot ropy act s in the opp osit e sense.

T he matter has to ® nd, t hough, a way of avoiding the vanishing of its

volum e.

As long as the mat ter is made up of stars, t his is manifest ly impossible.
When it is condensed int o a single mass, it is clear that it must have
acquired a high temperat ure much great er t han the critical temperat ure
of liquids and that not hing prevent s it at taining a degree of concent ration
comparable to the int erior of the companion of Sirius.

Even for a degenerat e gas it seems that not hing could oppose the

concent ration, since the available energy M/ R is unb ounded.

When the dist ances between the atomic nuclei and the elect rons be-
come of the order of 10- 1 2 cm, the non-Maxwellian forces which prevent
the mutual int erpenet ration of elementary part icles must become predom -
inant and are without doubt capable of stopping t he cont raction. T he
universe would then be comparable to a colossal atomic nucleus.
If the
cont raction is stopp ed, t he process should cont inue in the opposit e direc-
tion.

Adopt ing, following Eddingt on, 107 8 as the number of prot ons in ex-
istence, we have, as the order of magnit ude of the radius of t he universe
when reduced to its at omic state

10( 7 8/ 3 ) - 12 = 1014 cm ,

which is about ten times the dist ance to the Sun.

We thus conclude that only t he subat omic nuclear forces seem capable
of stopping the cont raction of the universe, when the radius of the universe
is reduced t o the dim ensions of the solar system.

For the cosmological point of view, t he zero of space must thus be
in the sense that every astronom ical structure

treated as a beginning,
with an earlier exist ence would have been complet ely destroyed t here.

T he epoch of this beginning, or, if one likes, of this recommencement,
certainly dat es from before the format ion of the Earth’ s crust and the
organizat ion of the solar system, that is as a strict minimum from the
st udy of radioact ive rocks

Comparing this value with Hubble’ s ratio

we conclude that all solut ions in which the expansion speed has always
been faster than it is now are excluded.

In part icular, for Einst ein’ s cycloidal universe (12.4) or the solut ion

(10.10) for small R/ R 0 , one has

t =

r

We must thus exclude the solut ions where the radius is less than the

equilibrium radius and in part icular the quasi-periodi c solut ions.

For a purely aesthetic point of view, one may perhaps regret this.
T hose solut ions where the universe expands and cont racts successively
while periodically reducing itself to an atomic mass of the dim ensions of
the solar system, have an indisput able poet ic charm and make one think
of the phoenix of legend.
